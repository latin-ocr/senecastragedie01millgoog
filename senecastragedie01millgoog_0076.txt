AGAMEMNON

Astyanax leads, there she,l to the Thessalian pyre
betrothed, she leading maids, he youths. Gaily do Ι

mothers bring votive offerings to the gods ; gaily do
fathers approach the shrines3 each wears but one

look the city o'er; and, what never we saw since '
Hector’s funeral, Hecuba was glad. And now, ›
unhappy grief, what first, what last, wilt thou ἰ
lament? Walls by divine hands· fashioned, by our 'J

own destroyed? Temples upon their own gods
consumed? Time lacks to weep such ills—thee, Ο

great father, the Trojan women weep. lsaw, Ι saw ,
in the old man's throat the sword of Pyrrhus scarce y

wet in his scanty blood.

cASSANnaA

Restrain your tears which all time will seek, ye
Trojan women, and do you yourselves grieve for
your own dead with groans and lamentations3my
losses resuse all sharing. Cease then your grief for
my disasters. Imyself shall suffice for the woes of

mine own house.
cuonus

'Tis sweet to mingle tears with tears3 griefs bring
more smart where they wound in solitude, but 'tis
sweet in company to bewail one’s friends ; nor shalt
thou, though strong, heroic, and inured to woe,
avail to lament calamities so great. Not the sad
nightingale,² which from the vernal bough pours

¹ Polyxena. 2 Into which Philomela was changed.
