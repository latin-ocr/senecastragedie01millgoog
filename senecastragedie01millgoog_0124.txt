please lesser men.l Wearied at last, may the impious χ
race of thirsty Tantalus give o’er its lust for savagery. ²
Enough sin has been wrought3 nothing has right
availed‚ or general wrong. Himself betrayed, fell
Myrtilus, betrayer of his lord, and, dragged down
by the saith which 116 had shown, he made a sea²

- famous by its change of name3 to lonian ships no

tale is better known. While the little son³ ran to ³
his father's kiss, welcomed by sinful sword, he fell,
an untimely victim at the hearth, and by thy right
hand was carved, Ο Tantalus, that thou mightest
spread a banquet for the gods, thy guests. Such
food eternal hunger, such eternal thirst pursues3
nor for such bestial viands could have been meted
penalty more fit.
1⁵2 Weary‚ with empty throat‚ stands Tantalus; ’
above his guilty head hangs food in plenty, than
Phineus’4 birds more elusive3 on either· side, with
laden boughS, a tree leans over him and, bending
and trembling ’neath its weight of fruit, makes sport
with his wide-straining jaws. The prize, though he
is eager and impatient of delay, deceived so oft, he
tries no more to touch, turns away his eyeS, shuts
tight his lips, and behind clenched teeth he bars his
hunger. But then the whole grove lets its riches
down nearer still, and the mellow fruits above his·
· head mock him with drooping boughs and whet
again the hunger, which bids him ply his hands in

'Tho Myrtoan sea, that ortion of the Aegean south 01
Euboea. The name is here lincilully derived from Myrtilus.
