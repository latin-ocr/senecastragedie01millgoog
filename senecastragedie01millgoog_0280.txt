Whoever has fallen on unkind fates.

HYLLUS

But Hercules himself slew Megara, pierced by his
arrows, and his own sons as well, shooting Lernaean
shasts with furious hand; still, though thrice mur-
derer, he forgave himself, but not his madness. At
the source of Cinyps ’neath Libyan skies he washed
away his guilt and cleansed his hands. Whithcr,
poor soul, dost haste thee? Why dost condemn thy ,

hands ?
nninwmn

’Tis Alcides’ overthrow thot doth condemn my
hands. 'Tis well to punish crime.

umus

lf 1 know Hercules, he will soon be here, pcr-
' chance victorious o'er the cruel plague3 and pain,

subdued, will yield to thy Alcides.

nninwrnr

The hydra's poison, as report declares, hath con·
sumed his frame3 the deadly plague hath wasted his
giant limbs.

rrimus

Thinkst thou the poison· of a serpent, slain, cannot
be overcome by him who met and overcame the
monster, living? He crushcd the hydra, and deep
in the mamb, with the fangs lixed in his flesh, he
stood victorious while his limbs were bathed in
venom. Shall Nessus' blood destroy the man who
overcome e'en the hands of savage Nessus?
