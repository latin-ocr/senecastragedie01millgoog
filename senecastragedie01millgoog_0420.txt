national conditions were ripe for the development of
any form of literature, the Greeks had already worked,

produced a mass of literature which dazzled the
Roman mind when at last circumstances brought
these two nations into closer contact.

tragedy and in comedy, a wholesale imitation of the
Greek diamas, oftentimes nothing more than a trans-
lation of these, with only here and there an attempt
to produce something of a strictly native character,
entirely independent of the Greek influence.
