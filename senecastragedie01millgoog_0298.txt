HERCULES OETAEUS

despoiled of heaven, bury me, father, 'neath the
whole ruined world; shatter the skies which thou art
doomed to lose.

Not vain thy fears, son of the Thunderer. Soon
now shall Pelion weigh down Thessalian Ossa, and
Athos, on Pindus heaped, shall thrust his forests
midst the heavenly stars ,· then shall Typhoeus
overcome the crags1 and upheave Tuscan Inarime;
the Aetnean furnaces then shall Enceladus upheave,
not yet by thy holt o’ercome, and rend the gaping
mountain’s side. E’en now the kingdoms of the sky '
are following thee2

Herculius

Lo I, who have escaped from death, who scorned
the Styx, who through the midst of Lethe’s pool
have returned with spoil,³ at sight whereof Titan
was almost flung from his falling car, I, whose
presence three realms of gods have felt, arn perishiug.
No deep-thrust sword grates through my side, nor is
all Othrys the instrument of my death; no giant
with fierce and gaping jaws has buried my body
beneath the whole of Pindus ; no, without enemy
am l overcome aud, thought which racks me more,
(shame to my manhood l) the last day of Alcides has
seen no monster slain. Ah, woe is me! l am
squandering my life forno return.
