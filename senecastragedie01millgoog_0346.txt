HERCULES OETAEUS
though falsely called—What lands shall an aged

woman seek, hated by savage kingr, if spite of all
any savage king is lest alive? Oh, woe is me! All
sonsl who lament their murdered sires will seek
revenge from me3 they all will overwhelm me. lf
any young Busiris or if any young Antaeus terrifies
the region of the 11111111118101111,2 l shall be led off as
booty3 if any Ismarian³ seeks revenge for the herds
of the bloody king4 of Thrace, upon my limbs
- will his horrid herds be fed, Juno, perchance, in
anger will seek revenge3 against me will the whole
force of her wrath incline; though her soul is no
more disturbed by Alcides, o’ercome at last, I, the
concubine, am left—ah! what punishments will she
inflict, lest l be again a mother! This son has made
ml⁷ll⁰v¹l¹sllhl÷lmsghlhfellkmena seer what place,
what region, what quarter of the world will take my
part, or to what hiding-place shall thy mother betake
herself, known everywhere through thee? Shall I
seek my fatherland and my wretched home?
Eurystheus is king at Argos Shall l seek ThebeS,
my husband’s kingdom, the Ismenus and my bridal
chamber, where once, greatly beloved by him, I

Δ looked on Jove? Oh, happy, far too happy hadl

been, if I myself, too,⁵ had known Jove's thunder-
bolt! Oh, would that from my womb the infant
Alcides had been ripped! But now was the chance
given me, yea 'twas given to see my son vying in
praise with Jove, that this, too, might be given me-
to know ol how much fate had power to rob me.
