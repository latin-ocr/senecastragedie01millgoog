PHOENISSAE

have Ι desired to die for thee-at length exact the ,
debt. Now am Ι paying my penalty; before, Ι did
but offer sacrifices to thy ghost. Come to my aid,
help me to plunge my nerveless hand deep down and
deeper; timidly‚ aforetime‚ and with but a meagre
outpouring did it sprinkle my head, when it scarce
drew forth the eyes that yearned to follow. Even
now this soul of mine haus, yes halts‚ when my face
has bent downward to my shrinking hands. Thou
shalt hear the truth, Oedipus: less boldly didst
thou pluek out thine eyes than thou didst undertake
to do. Thrust now thy hand e'en to the brain;

through that door whereby Ι began to die fulfil my

death.

ANTlooNs

Father, great-souled, l beseech thee that with
calm mind thou 'listen to some few words of thy
wretched daughter. Ι seek not to lead thee back
again to the splendours of thine ancient home, and
to thy royal estate, flourishing in power and fame;
nor do Ι ask that thou bear with calm and peaeeful
soul that tempest of passion which has not been
allayed even by lapse of time; and yet ’twere fitting

, that one so stalwart should not yield to pain nor

turn in flight, by disaster overcome. Itis notman-
hood, father, as thou deemst it, to shrink from life,
but to make stand against mighty ills and neither
turn nor yield. He who has trodden destiny under
foot, who has torn off and thrown away life’s blessings,
and himself piled up the ‚burden of his woes, who has
no need of God, wherefore should he desire death, or
wherefore seek it? Each is a coward's act; no one
despises death who yet yearns for it. He whose
misfortunes ean no further go, is safely lodged.
