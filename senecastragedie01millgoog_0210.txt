HERCULES OETAEUS

Ι destroyed, and have brought away Thermodon's
spoils10f war. The lot of the silent throng have 1
beheld3 ¹and not alone have l returned, but shuddering · ι
day hath seen black Cerberus, and he the sun. No >
longer doth the Libyan Antaeus renew his strength 3
before his own altars hath Busiris fallen3 by my sole
hand hath Geryon been o’erthrown, and the bull,
dread terror of a hundred tribes. Whatever hostile
earth hath 'gendered is fallen, by my right band
laid low; the anger of the gods hath been set at
naught.²

3⁰ If the earth is done with monsterS, if my step-
dame is done with wrath, give back now the father to
his son, yea, the stars unto the hero. Ι ask thee not
to show the way to me; but grant thy permission,
father, and the way l’ll find. Or, if thou fearest that
earth shall yet give birth to monsters, let the ill make
haste, whate'er it be, while yet the earth doth hold
and look on Hercules 3 for who else will attack evil
things, or who, throughout the Argive cities, will be
worthy Juno’s hate? 1 have my honours safe be-
stowed; there is no land but sings my praise. The
race that shivers 'neatb the Scythian Bear³ bath
known me; the sun-scorched Indian and the tropic
African. Ο glowing Suri, bear witness: 1 have
encountered thee where'er thou shinest, nor could

. thy beams keep pace with my triumphant course;

l have gone beyond the changes of the sun, and day
· hath halted far within my bounds. Nature hath
yielded to me, and earth hath failed my feet; she

hath been weary first* Night and utter chaos have

³ ic. the Scythiam, dwelling far north beneath the Bear.

⁴ It is as if the whole earth, trying to keep paca with
Hercules, and to ‘ve him new land to trave] over, has .
become waary of t e attempt.
