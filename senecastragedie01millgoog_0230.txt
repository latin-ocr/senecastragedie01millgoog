HERCULES OETAEUS

stubbom serpent, now to a heroe bull changed his
threats, the serpent form discarded, and thou in that
one foe didst conquer a thousand beasts. But now l
please thee not; a captive is preferred to me-but
she shall not be preferred3 for that day which shall
end our marriage joys shall end thy life.

³⁰⁷ But what is this? My passion dies away and

Δ abates its threats. Now anger eeases3 why dost

thou languish, Ο wretched grief? Thou givest o'er
thy madness, makest me again the faithful, uncom-
plaining wife—Why dost forbid the feeding of the
flames? Why checkest the lire? Keep but this
passion in me; hand in hand let us go on-there
will be no need of prayers3 a step-damel will be

near to direct my hands and unbesought. ’

NURSE

What crime, distraught one, dost thou purpose?

Wilt slay thy husband whose praises the evening and ’

the morning² know full well, whose fame, towering

³ to the sky, holds all the world beneath? The land ‘

of Greece will rise to defend that home, and this thy
father’s⁸ house and the whole Aetolian race will be
the first to be 0’erthrown; soon rocks and firebrands
will be hurled against thee, since every land will
rally to its defender. How many penalties wilt thou,
one woman, pay! Suppose thou canst escape the
world and the raee of men-the father of Alcides
wields the thunder·bolt. Now, even now behold his
threat’ning fires flashing athwart the sky, and the
heavens thundering with the lightning shock. Even
death itself, which thou deemest a place of safety‚

1κΙιιιιο. ² te. East and West.
