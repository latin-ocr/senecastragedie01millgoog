v thou with troubled face? Why are thy cheeks wet

with weeping? Surely the day sought by our prayers ·

and vows has dawned3 to thy Caesar art thou joined
by the marriage torch, him whom thy beauty snared,
whom Venus hath delivered in bouds to thee, Venus,
of Seneca llouted, mother 01 Love, most mighty
deity. Oh, how beautiful and stately wast thou on
the high couch reclining in the hall! The senate
looked on thy beauty in amare, when incense to the
gods thou offeredst and with pleasing wine didst

thee, majestic midst the favouring plaudite 01 the ,
citizens, walked the prince himself, showing, in look
and bearing, his joy and pride. So did Peleus take

My sad heart, dear nurse, is confused and troubled

3 by a fearful vision 01 yester-night, and my senses
ᾗ reel. For, alter joyful day had to the dark stars
yielded, and the sky to night, held close in my Nero’s
l arms l lay relaxed in slumber. But not long was it

granted to enjoy sweet rest ; for my marriage chamber
seemed thronged with many moumers; with stream-
ing hair did Roman matrons come, making tearful
lamentations ; midst oft repeated and fearful trumpet
blasts, my husband's mother,1 with threatening mien
and savage, brandished a blood-spattered torch.
