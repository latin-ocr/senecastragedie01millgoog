by hostile hor-ies, has seen armeni squudrons glenxning
froin arnt, the cadmean niemows tnmpiefl hy ssying
hooss, princes in their chnriots eni-eenng high, the
smoke and flames ofbhzing torehes which seek m burn
0¹¹1· homes, nna brothers (a ei-ime new even ω Thebes)
nithing upon mh other. This ei-iine the whole nrniy
saw, this, nn the peuple, this, both thy sistens saw and 1,
thy mother, saw—for thy father owes it ω his own net
that he beheld not such deeds. Let Oedipus stand

No one ποι-ΚΞ such havoe on his own; what thou
