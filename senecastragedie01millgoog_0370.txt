PHOENISSAE

’ y nnrroour -

No force, my father, shall loose my hold of thee;

no one shall ever tear me from thy side. The
sovereignty of Labdacus’ noble house and all its
riches-let my brothers light over these3 the best
part of my father’s migbty kingdom is my own, my
father's self. Him no brother shall take from me,
not he1 who holds the Theban sceptre by stolen
right, not he2 who is leading tlre Argive hosts ;-
no, though Jove should rend the universe with his
thunderS, and his bolt fall 'twixt our embrace, Ι
will not let go my hands. Thou mayst forbid me,
father3 I’ll guide thee against thy will, l'll direct
thine unwilling feet. Wouldst go to the level plain?
Ι go. Wouldst seek the craggy mountains? l
oppose not, but Ι go before. Whither thou wilt,
use me as guide3 by two will all paths be chosen.
ι Without me thou canst not perisl13 with me thou
canst: Here rises a cliff, lofty, precipitouS, and looks
out upon the long reaches of the underlying sea;
wouldst have us seek it? Here is a bare rock over-
hanging, here the riven earth yawns with gaping
jaws; shall we go here? Here a raging torrent
falls and rolls along worn fragments of the fallen
mountains3 shall we plunge to this? Where’er
thou wilt, Ι go, so it be first. I neither oppose nor
urge. Art eager t0 be destroyed, and is death,
father, thy highest wish? lf thou diest, Ι go before
thee3 if thou livest, Ι follow. But change thy
purpose3 summon up thine old-time courage3
conquer thy sorrows and with all thy might be
master of them, resist them3 amidst such woes‚ to
be conquered is to die.
