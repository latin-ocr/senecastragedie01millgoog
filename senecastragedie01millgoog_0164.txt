THYESTES

⁶⁰⁷ O you, to whom the ruler of sea and land has
given unbounded right 0'er life and death, abate your
inflated, swelling pride3 all that a lesser subject
fears from you, ’gainst you a greater lord shall
threaten ; all power is subject to a weightier power.
Whom the rising sun hath seen high in pride, him ζ
the setting sun hath seen laid low. Let none be·

’ over-confident when fortune smiles ; let none despair

of better things when fortune fails. Clotho blends l
weal and woe, lets no lot stand, keeps every fate l
a-turning. No one has found the gods so kind that ἓ
he may promise to-morrow to himself. God keeps *i

all mortal things in swift whirl turning. l

[Enfer nrssauouu hreathlesslp arrnouncing the horror Ἰ

What whirlwind will headlong bear me through
the air and in murky cloud enfold me, that it may
snatch this awful horror from my sight? Ο house,
to Pelops even and to Tantalus a thing of shame!

CHORUS

What news bringst thou?

massaneto

What place is this? Is it Argos? Is it Sparta,
to which fate gave loving brothers?1 Corinth,
resting on the narrow boundary of two seas? Or
the Ister, giving chance of flight to the barbarous
Alani? Or the Hyrcanian ¹ land ’neoth its ever-
' lasting snows? Or the wide-wandering Scythians? ¹
What place is this that knows such hideous crime?
