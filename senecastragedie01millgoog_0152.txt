THYESTES

the Parthians; no incense burns for me, nor are my
shrines adorned in neglect of Jove3 no planted
grove waves on my battlements, nor does many a
pool heated by art steam for me3 my days are not
given to sleep nor are my nights linked with wakeful
revelry: but l am not feared, safe without weapons

is my house and to my small estate great peace is
granted. 'Tis a boundless kingdom—the power
without kingdoms to be content.

TANTALUS

Neither is empire to be refused if a god bestows it,
nor needst thou seek it; thy brother invites thee to
be king.

maratus

Brotherly regard ofttimes returns unto the heart
whence it was driven, and true love regains the
vigour it has lost.

rarasras

His brother love Thyestes? Sooner shall ocean
bathe the heavenly Bears, and the devouring waves
of the Sicilian tides stand still; sooner shall ripening
grain spring from the Ionian sea, and dark night
illume the world3 sooner shall fire with water, life
with death commingle, and winds join faith and

treaty with the sea.
mitratus

Α And yet what treachery dost thou sear?

Tnvssrlts ¹

All treachery; to my sear what limit shall l set?
His* power is boundless as his hate.
