HERCULES OETAEUS

ceilings break our rest, and purple coverlets drag out
wakeful nights. Oh, if the hesrts of rich men
were leid bare! What fears does losty fortune stir
within! Τὴε waves of Bruttium, when Corusl
leshes up the sea, are culmer far. The poor man's
,heart is free from care3 he holds cups carved from
the wide-spreading beech, but holds them with hand
untrembling; he ests but cheap and common food‚
yet sees no drawn sword² hanging o'er his head!
’Tis in golden cups that blood is mixed with wine.⁸
⁶⁵⁸ The wife who is wed to one of modest means
is not bedecked with necklaces of pearl‚ the red seu's
gift, nor do stones gethered on Orient shores weigh
down her gem-leden ears ; for her nosoft wool twice
dipped iu Sidonian cauldrons drinks scarlet dyes;
not hers with Maeonian4 needle to embroider stuffs
which Serians under sunlitskies gether⁵ from eastern
trees. 'Tis but common herhs thet dyc the webs
which her unskilled hands have woven3 but she

cherishes a marriage-couch sll undisturbed. With
cruel torch doth F ury pursue the bride whose wed-
dingday great throngs heve celebrated ; nor does the
poor man count himself full blest, unless he sees the
blessed fallen from their height.

⁰⁷⁶ Whoever has lest the middle course fares never
in path secure. While forone day the youth θ sought

⁶ The reference is to silk-culture, for which the Seres (the

Chinese) were well known among the encients.
