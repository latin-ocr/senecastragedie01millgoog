AGAMEMNON

ι hunsl:

O Queen, restrain thyself, check thine impetuous
wrath and think what thou art daring3 the conqueror
of wild Asia is at hand, Europe’s avenger, dragging
in triumph captive Pergama and the Phrygiens, long
since subdued. Against him now with guile and

stealth dost thou essay to fight, whom Achilles with ξ
·his savage sword hurt not, though in grim wrath he ἶ

armed his insolent hand, nor the better Ajax1 raging
and bent on death, nor Hector, sole bulwark against
the warring Greeks, nor the sure-aimed shafts of
Paris, nor swarthy Memnon, nor Xanthus, rolling
down corpses and arms commingled, nor Simois, its
waves running red with blood, nor Cycnus, snowy2

offspring of the Ocean-god, nor warlike Rhesus and ·
his Thracian horde, nor the Amazon, with her painted 1

quiver, battle-axe in hand, and crescent shield?

Him, home-returning‚ dost thou prepare to slay and “

to defile thine altars with slaughter impious? Will
victorious Greece leave such a deed unavenged?
Horses and arms, the sea studded with ships, set
these before thine eyes, the ground flowing with
streame of blood, and the whole fate of the captured
house of Dardanus turned ’gainst the Greeks.³
Control thy fierce passions, and do thou thyself set
thine own soul at peace. [Exit.

Anorsruus [ia soliloquy]

The hour which always in my heart and soul Ι
dreaded is here indeed, the hour of fate for me.

³ 220. Agamemnon’e death will be as terribly avenged as
was the injury to Helen.
