PHOENISSAE

sons Flames, if thou prefer, and a huge mound
prepare; myself, will Ι fling me on the lofty pyre,
embrace the flames, and hide in the funeral pile.
There will Ι set free this stubborn soul and give up
to ashes this—all that is lest of me alive. Where is
the raging sea? Lead me where some beetling crag
juts out with its high, rocky cliff, or where swift
Ismenus rolls his wild waters. lf thou art my guide,
thither would Ι go to die where on a high cliii the
Sphinx once sat and wove crasty speech with her
half-bestial lips Guide my feet thither, there set
thy father. Let not that dreadful seat be empty,
but place thereon a greater monster. 011 that rock
will Ι sit and propound the dark riddle of my fate
which none may answer. All ye who till the fields
once ruled by the Assyrian king,1 who suppliant
worship in the grove of Cadmus for the serpent
famed, where sacred Dirce lies3 all ye who drink of
the Eurotas, who dwell in Sparta for its twin
brethren² famous; ye farmers who reap Elis and
Parnassus and Boeotia’s fertile fields‚ give ear. That
dire pest of Thebes, who wrapped death-dealing
words in puzaling measureS, what riddle like this
did she ever propound? What maze so bewildering?
He ruas his grandfather’s roo-irr-lum aad his father’s
moal, brother of hir children aad father os his brothers;
al one birth the graadmother hore children to her husband
ond graadchihlren lo herseffi Who can unfold a coil
so monstrous? Even Ι, who gained spoils from the
conquered Sphinx, shall prove but slow in unriddling
mine own doom.
