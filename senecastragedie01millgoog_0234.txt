but ’twas while yet her father reigned secure, and
'twas a king’s daughter that he sought. The
princess has now fallen to the place of slave3 love

Nay, but fallen fortunas fan hotter the flames of
love; for this very cauae he loves her, that she hath
lost her father’s house, that her hair lies stripped of
gold and gems; out of pity, perchance, he loves her
very woes3 ’tis the wont of Hercules telove captive

’Tis true he loved the captive sister1 of Dardaniam
Priam, but he gave herto another32 add all the
dames, all the maids he loved before. A wanderer
on earth, a wanderer in love was he. Why, the
Arcadian maiden, Auge, while leading Pallas’ sacred
dance, suffered his lust's violence, but fell from his
regard, and Hercules retains no trace of his love for
her. Why mention others? The Thespiades are
forgotten3 for them with but a passing flame Alcides
burned. When a guest on Timolus, he caressed the
Lydian woman³ and, dast with love, sat beside her
swist distall, twisting the moistened thread with
doughty fingers. His shoulders, indeed, had laid
aside the famous lion's-skin, a turban confined his
hair, and there he stood like any slave, his shaggy
locks dripping with Sabaean myrrh. Everywhere has
he burned with love, but burned with feeble flame.
