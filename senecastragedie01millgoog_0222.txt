HERCULES OETAEUS

sisters; or addl me to the rocks of Sicily, where as
a Siren Ι may weep Thessalia's fate; or bear me to
Edonia’s2 woods where Ι may mourn as, beneath
Ismarian shade, the Daulian bird³, ever moums her

maid, yet guards her tears34 the wife⁵ of Ceyx
mourns his taking off ; and Niobe lives on, surviving
e’en herself ; her human form has Philome] escaped,
and still the Attio maid bewails her son.6 Why not
yet do my arms become swift wings? Happy, ah, ’
happy shall 1 be when the woods shall be called my
home, and, in my native meadows testing, with
plaintive strains Ι shall recall my fate, and fame shall
tell of winged Iole.

²0⁷1 saw,l saw my father's wretched fate, when,
beaten down by the death-dealing club, he lay in
scattered fragments throughout the hall. Ah me, if
fate had given him burial, how osten, father, must
thou have been sought! How could Ι have looked
upon thy death, Ο Toxeusff with thy boyish cheeks
as yet unbearded, and thy veins not yet filled with

manly vigour? But why do l lament your fates, my .

borne? ’Tis my own fortune that requires my tears.
Soon, soon in captive state shall Ι whirl the distaff

and the spindle of my mistress O cruel beauty,

⁴ The exuding gum oi the myrrh tree into which the maid
wpsppppglegfflss alive in feathered form.

⁰ Itys was not theson of Philomela, but oi her sister,
Procne. 'Her brother.
