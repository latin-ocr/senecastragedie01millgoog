THYESTES

Stygian shades and, by a huge opening to void chaos,
snateh this kingdom with its king away? Why dost
not raze this whole palaneto the very ground, and
overturn Mycenae i We should both of us long since
have been with Tantalus Rend asunder thy prison·
bars on every side, and 11 there is any place 'neath

¹ Tartarus and our grandsires,¹ thither with huge abyss

let down thy chasm and hide us buried beneath all
Acheron. Let guilty souls wander above our head,
and let fiery Phlegethon, with glowing flood down·
pouring all his sands, llow tempestuous above ourl
place of exile—but the earth lies all unmoved, an
insensate mass3 the gods have fled away.

Now, rather, take these with joy, whom thou hast
so long desired. Thy brother delays thee not3 enjoy
them, kiss them, divide thy embraces ’mongst the

three.

Tut'us'rss

Is this thy bond? Is this thy grace, this' thy
fraternal pledge? Thus puttest thou hate away?
1 do not ask that l, a father, may have my sons un·
harmed3 what can be granted with crime and hate
intact, this l, a brother, of a brother ask: that I may
bury them. Give me back what thou mayst see
burned at once. The father asks naught of thee
with hopes of having, but of losing it.

ATREUS

Whatever of thy sons is lest, thou hast; whatever
is not lest, thou hast.

¹He means Tantalus alona, using tha plural ior the
singular by errallaye. 173
