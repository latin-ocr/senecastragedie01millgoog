PHOENISSAE
¹4⁰ Why dost thou waste further words? Why dost

try to sosten my hard heart with prayers? My will
is fixed to pour forth this life which has long been
struggling with death, and to seek the nether dark-
ness; for this deep night is not deep enough for my
crime3 in Tartarus would Ι be huried‚ or if there be
aught deeper than Tartams3 ’tis pleasing to do at
last what long ago 1 should have done. Ι cannot be
kept from death. Wilt withhold the sword? Wilt
bar paths where Ι might fall to death? Wilt keep
my neck from the choking noose? Wilt remove
death-bringing herbs? What, pray, will that care os
thine accomplish? Death is everywhere. This hath
God with wisdom excellent provided: of life amyone
can rob amau, but of death no one; to this a thousand
doors lie open. Ι ask for naught. This right hand,
though bare, my soul hath practice to use well—O
hand of mine, come now with all thy force, with all
thy smarting rage, with all thy might. Not one spot
only do Ι mark out for the wound—I am all sin3
inflict death where thou wilt. Break through my
breast and tear out my heart, which has room for so
many crimes; lay bare my vitals‚ every nook3 rain
resounding hlows upon my neck until it break, and
let my veins flow, torn by my gouging fingers. Or
aim thy mad attack at the accustomed place ;1 these
wounds reopen; bathe them in streame of blood and
gore3 through this passage drag out my stubbom life,
lhllllnffdlrnlelddllllu‘lllllsel'lllle'etllll
deemed that this grievous crime of mine was
sufficiently atoned by any suffering, nor have Ι been
content with such death as this, nor have Ι bought
my pardon witha portion of myself ; limb by limb
