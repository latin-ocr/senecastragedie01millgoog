CHORUS OE TROJAN WOMEN

Aias, how alluring a bane is appointed unt01 *
mortaIS, even dire love of life, though refuge from
their woes opes wide, and death with generous
hand invites the wretched, a peaceful port of ever· y
lasting rest. Nor fear nor stonn of raging Fortune
disturbs that calm, nor bolt of thenharsh Thunderer. ,i
Peace so deep fears no citizens' conspiracy, no victor's j
threatening wrath, no'wild seas ruffled by stormy ι
winds, no fierce battle lines or dark cloud raised by ἷ y
barbarie squadrons’ hoofs, no nations falling with
their city’s utter overthrow, while the hostile flames
lay waste the waHS, no fierce, ungovernable war.
‘All bonds will he break through, who dares scorn '¹
the fickle gods, who on the face of dark Acheron, on ΙΙ
fearful Styx can look, unfearful, and is bold enough i

r to put an end to life. Α match for kings, a match ζ

arrangement, by reading ll. 605-609 aster l. 595. He then
'privata l. 596 with a lacuna: Alta pax . . . nullos.
