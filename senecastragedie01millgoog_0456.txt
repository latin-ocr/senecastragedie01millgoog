OCTAVIA

⁸4⁶ E’en while she speaks the waves wash o’er her
lips, and down into the deep she plunges; anon she

rises from the briny weight and with her hands, sear .

driving her, lashes the sea; but soon, outwearied,
gives o’er the struggle. There· still lived in secret
hearts1 fidelity which scorned the grim fear of
death. Many to their mistress dare bring aid,
when her strength is exhausted by the sea, and, as
she drags her arms, though sluggishly, along, with
their voices cheer her and list her with their hands.

, But what availed it to have escaped the waters of
¹ the cruel sea? By the sword of thine own son thou

art to die, to whose crime scarce will posterity,
slowly will all future ageS, give belief. He rages
and grieves that his mother, snatched from the sea,
still lives, the impious monster, and heaps huge
guilt on guilt3 bent on his wretched mother's
death, he brooks no stay of crime. Sent to the
task, his creature works his will, and with the sword
lays open his mistress’ breast. The unhappy woman,
dying, begs her murderer to sheathe his fell sword
. within her womb: “'Tis this, ’tis this that must
with the sword be pierced, which gave such monster

l birth!” After such utterance, with a dying groan

commingled, at length through the cruel wound she

ξ yielded her sad ghost.
