HERCULES OETAEUS

shades, to the realm of sleepless Cerberus, whence
he will never more return. Let thy bright rays be
overcast with clouds3 gaze on the grieving world
with pallid face and let disfiguring mists roam o'er
thy head. When, Ο Titan, where, beneath what
sky wilt thou follow another Hercules on the earth?
To whose aid will the wretched world appeal if ³
within Lerna's swamp some many-headed pest in a
hundred snakes shall spread its poisonous rage3 if
for the ancient tribes of Arcady some boar shall
disturb the quiet 01 the woods ; if some s0n10f
Thracian Rhodope, harder than the ground 01 snow-
clad Helice, shall spatter his stalls with the blood 01
men? Who to the trembling nations will give peace,
if the angry gods shall raise up new monsters o'er

the world? Level with all men he lies,2 whom ,

earth produced level with the Thunderer. Through
conntless cities let eries 01 brief resonnd ; let
women with streaming hair smite their bare arms;
let the temples 01 all gods be closed save his step-
dame's only, for she only is free from care.

15l⁰Thou farest to Lethe and the Stygian shore

= whence no·keel will ever bring thee back; thou
farest, lamented one, unto the ghosts whence, over-
coming Death, thou didst once return in triumph,
now but a shade, with fleshless arms, wan face and
drooping neck} nor will that skiff, which once bore
thee alone and feared 'twould be plunged beneath

¹ Like Diomedes, the bloody tyrant 01 Thrace.
² ie brought to the common level by death. ,
