⁸¹³ Heaven's aecustomed alternations are no more;
no settiug, no rising shall there be again. The dewy
motherl of the early dawn, wont to hand o’er to the
god his morning reins, looks in amaze upon the

disordered threshold of her kingdom3 she is not
skilled‘2 to bathe his weary chariat, nor to plunge his
steeds, reeking with sweat, beneath the sea. Startled
himself at such unwonted weleoming, the sinking
sun beholds Aurora, and bids the shadows arise,
though night is not yet ready. No stars come out;
the heavens gleam, not with any lires: no moon
dispels the darkness' heavy pall.

⁸2⁷ But whatever this may be, would that night
were here! Trembling‚ trembling are our hearts,
sore smit with fear, lest all things fall shattered in
fatal ruin and once more gods and men be o'erwhelmed
by formless chaos ; lest the landS, the eneireling sea,
and the stars that wander in the spangled sky, nature
blot out once more. No more by the rising of his
quenchless torch shall the leader of the stars‚ guiding
the procession of the years, mark off the summer and
the winter times; no more shall Luna, reflecting
, Phoebus’ rays, dispel night's terrors, and outstrip
her brother's reins, as in scantier space8 she speeds

on her circling path. lnto one abyss shall fall the ,

heaped-up throng of gods. Τὴε Zodiae, which,
making passage through the sacred stars‚ crosses the
zones obliquely, guide and sign-bearer for the slow-
moving years, falling itself, shall see the fallen
