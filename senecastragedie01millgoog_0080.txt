tombsl have drunk up my blood. What of that
happy throng of brothers? Gone, all! in the
empty palaoe only sad old men are lest ; and
throughout those many chambers they see all
women, save her of Sparta, widowed. That mother
of so many kingS, queen of the Phrygiam, Hecuba,
fruitful for funeral-lires, proving new laws of fate
has put on bestial form22 around her ruined walls
madly she barked, surviving Troy, son, husband

and herself !

The bride of Phoebus suddenly is still, pallor
o'erspreads her cheeks, and constant tremors master
all her frame. Her fillets stand ereet, her solt looks
rise in horror, her la'bouring heart sounds loud with
pent murmuring, her glance wanders uncertain, ·
¹her eyes seem baekward turned into herself, anon
they stare unmoving. Now she liftsv her head into
the air higher than her wont, and walks with stately
tread3 now makes to unlock her struggling lips, now
vainly tries to close them on her words, a mad
Δ priestess fighting against the god.

CASSANDRA

with fury’s goads anew, why do you sweep me on,
berest of sense? Away! O Phoebus, Ι am no
longer thine3 quenoh thou the flames set deep
within my breast. For whose sake wander Ι now in
madness? for whose sake in frenzy rave? Now ·
Troy has fallen—what have I, false prophetem,
to do?
