OCTAVIA

ocrlvrr [heard speakingfrom lter chamber]

Ο fate of mine, to be matehed by no missortuneS,
though Ι recall thy woes‚ Electra. Thou couldst

weep out thy grief for thy father’s murder, couldst

take vengeance on the crime with thy brother as
avenger, whom thy love snatched from the foe and

thy faithful care protected3 but me fear forbids to
mourn my parents reft from me by eruel fate, forbids
to bewail my brother’s taking off, in whom was my
sole hope, the fleeting soloce of my many woes. And
now, saved but to my suffering, 1 remain, the shadow
of a noble name.

u
Hark! the voice of mynlshll foster-child strikes on

mine ears. Does thy slow age take thee to her
chamber with lagging steps?

[She odouacer toward the chamber, bot ia met by Octavia,
corning forth]
