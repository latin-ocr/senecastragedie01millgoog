For Ι have got tho bleasing oi great joy.''

With these words she covers up the real desires oi her

complete downiall oi Troy, which came as a punishment

“who has not broken
One sea] cf his iu all this length oi time.''

The herald, in response to further questions oi the chorus,
describes the great storrn which wreeked the Greek fleat
upon their homeward voyage.
