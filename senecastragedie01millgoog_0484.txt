thy father's house dost look back witli streaming
eyes? Haste thee to leave this roof3 abandon the
blood-stained palace of the emperor. [Exit.

CHORUS

Lo, now has dawned the day long dim foreseen,
so oft by rumour bruited. Departed is Claudia¹
from cruel Nero's chamber, which e’en now Poppaea
,holds in triumph, while lags our love by grievous
fear repressed, and grief is numb. Where is the
Roman peoplc's manhood now, which oft in olden
times haih crushed illustrious chiefs, given laws to
an unconquered land,² the fasces to worihy citizens,
made war and peace at will, conquered wild races
and imprisoned captive kings? Lo, grievous to our
sight, on every hand now gleams Poppaea’s image,
with Nero’s joined! Let violent hands throw them

to the ground, too like their mistress‘ features3 let
³ them drag her down from her lofty couch, and then

l with dev'ouring flames and savage spears attack the
palace of the emperor. . [Exit cnonus.
