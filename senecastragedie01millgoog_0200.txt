THYESTES

the mountains-thesc arms let loose and hurl thy
fires. Make compensation for the banished day,
brandish thy flameS, and the light that was snatched
from heaven with thy lightning's flash supply. Let
the cause, lest long thou hesitate, of each one of us

be evil; if not, let mine be evil; aim thou at me,
through this heart send thy three-forked flaming
bolt. ll l their father would give his sons to burial
and commit them to the funeral flames, l must
myself be burned. But if naught moves the gods ’
and no divinity hurls darts against the impious, may ἰ
night stay on for ever, and cover with endless dark- J
ness boundless crimes. No protest do l make, 0 y
sumis thou continue steadfast.¹

ATREUS

Now dol praise my handiwork, now is the true
palm won. 1 had wasted my crime, didst thou not .
suffer thus. Now do l believe my children are my

own, now mayl trust once more that my marriage-
bed is pure. ¹
