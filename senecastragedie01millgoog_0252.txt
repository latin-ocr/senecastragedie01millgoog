HERCULFS OETAEUS

0111111111

Thee do I pray, by earth and heaven-dwellers held
11110111· „bysea by him who wields Aetnaean¹ thunder-
bolis, and by thy ruthless mother to be ferred, 0
winged boy; with unerring hand aim a swift shast,
1111111101 01 thy lighter arrows. Choose thee, 1 pray,
one 01 thy heavier shafts, which thy hands have
ne’ er yet shot at any3 101 110 light weapon must thou
use that Hercules may feel the power of love.
Stretch thy hands stiffly forth, 01111 bend thy bow
until the tips shall meet. NoW, now that shast let
loose with which once thou aimedst ot Jove the
terrible, what time the god threw down his thunder-
bolt and as a buil, with horns quiek-sprouting on his
broiv, elove through the boisterous sea, bearing the
Assyrian maid.² F ill hirnwith love ; let him outstrip
1111 precedents,-—let him leam to love his wife. 1f
Iole’s beauty hath kindled fires in the breast of
HerculeS, extinguish them every one, 0111101 my
beauty let him deeply drink. 0st hast thou oon-
quered Jove, the thunderer, ost him who wields the
dark sceptre of the dusky world, king 01 the greater
throng‚ and lord of Styx3 and now, Ο god more
dreadful than a stepdame’s wrath, win thou this
triumph all alone, and conquer Hercules.
