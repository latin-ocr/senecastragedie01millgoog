HERCULES OETAEUS

⁸2⁸ “But hold ! ” said Hercules 3 “ ’tis not madness
has robbed me of my wits; this bane is worse than
madness and than rage3 l am fain to rave against
myself.'’1 Searce has he named the plague when
lo, he raves, he tears his own flesh apart, with his
own hand woundiug and rending his huge limbs.
He seeks to throw aside the robe; i'n this alone have

, Ι seen Alcides fail. Yet striving to tear the robe,

he tears his limbs as well. The robe is part and
parcel of his rugged body3 the pest blends lt with
the skin. The cause oi his dire suffering· is hid, but
still there is a eause3 and, scarce able to endure his
. pain, now he lies spent, face down upon the ground,
now calls for water—water checks not his pain ; lie
seeks the wave-resounding shore and plunges in the
sea, but a slave’s hand restrains him wandering
aimless there-oh, bitter lot! we were Alcides’
e uals!²

q⁸³⁹ And now a vessel is bringing him from Euboea’s
shore, aud a gentle south wind wafts his huge bulk
along ; his spirit has left his body; night seals his
e es.

Why, soul, dost hesitate? Why art amared? The
crime is done. Jupiter demands back his sou of
thee, Juno, her rival3 year, to the world must he be
restored.³ What still thou canst, give back, make
restitution; let the sword, deep driven, through my
body pass. So, so must it be done. But does so
frail hand as this exact punishment so great? With
thy thunderboltS, Ο sire, destroy thy guilty daughter.

able to control him.

³ She has robbed the world ol Herculea, and now must
make such restitution aa she may.
