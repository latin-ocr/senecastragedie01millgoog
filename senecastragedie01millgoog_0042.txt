If that is not enough, say grandson, too.

Phoebus was the source of my begetting3 my
birth shames me not.

. OLYTEMNESTRA

Dost thou name Phoebus as source of an inces-
tuous birth, whom, calling back his steeds in sudden
night, you1 drove from heaven? Why besmirch the
gods? Thou, trained by guile to steal the marriage
bed, depart at once, take from my sight the infamy
of our house ;. this home is waiting for its king and

lord.
nnorsrnns

Exile is not new to me; Ι am used to woe. If
thou commandest, Ο queen, not alone from home
and Argos doI flee: Ι am ready at thy bidding to
plunge sword into my heart, 0'erweighed with grief.

ctrrnnrnsrna [aride]

Yet, should 1, cruel daughter of Tyndareus, let
this be done.

[To heutardus]
Who jointly sins owes also faith to crime. Come
thou with me, that the dark and threatening state
of our affairs joint pians may set in order. [Errant.

CHORUS

Sing ye,O maids renowned‚ of Phoebus! To thee,
Phoebus, the festal throng wreaths the head, to thee,
waving laurel-bough, the Argive maid in wonted

¹ ia, your house. At the horrid feast oi Thyestes the sun
veiled his iace in darkness that he might not see. 29
