table leaps up from the trembling floor. The lights
burn dim; nay, the very beaveris, grown heavy, stand
in amaze 'twixt day and night,l deserted.2 What next?
Now more, still more the vauls of the shattered sky

gathering‚ and night has hidden away in a blacker
night; every star is in full flight. Whate'er it is, I
beg it may spare my brother and my sons, and may
the storm break with all its force on this vile head. ’
Give back now my sons to me!

Aratus

Ι will give them back, and no day shall tear them ‚
from thee. [Exit.

THYESTES

What is this tumult that disturbs my vitais? What
trembles in me? 1 feel a load that will not suffer
me, and my breast groans with a groaning that is

calls you, come3 this pain will pass away at the sight
of you—whence corne their reproachful voices?

[Re-enter nonnos with a covered plciter in his hands]

Aratus

Now, father, spread out thine arms; they are here.
[Hc uncovers the pliciter, reveah'ng the covered heads of
ruvrsrss' som] Dost recognize thy sons?

THYESTES

I recognize my brother. Canst thou endure, Ο
Barth, to bear a crime so monstrous? Why dost not
burst asunder and plunge thee down to the infernal

² ie. by sun, moon, ond stass.
