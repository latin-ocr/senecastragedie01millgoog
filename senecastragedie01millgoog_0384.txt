for wild heasts and savage birds which baleful
Cithaeron, oft stained with royal blood, doth breed.
Yet him whom God condemned, whom his sire cast
away, hath death also shunned. l kept saith with
Delphi; Ι assailed my father and with impious
death-stroke slew him. For this another act of
piety will atone; l killed my father, true, but my
mother-l loved. Oh, 'tis shame to speak of wed-

l lock and my marriage torches But this punishment

also force thyself to bear though against thy will;
proclaim thy crime, unheard of, bestial, unexampled,
at which nations would shudder, which no age
would believe ever besell, which would put even a
, parricide to shamc: into myjbther’s bed I bore hands
macared ⁴raith myfailrer’s blood, aad itere, aa the reward
of my omme, I did worse crime

2⁷⁰ A trivial sin is my father’s murder; my mother,
brought to my marriage chamber, that my guilt might
be complete, conceived-no greater crime than this
can nature brook. And yet, if there is even now
worse crime, we have given the world those who can
commit it. Ι have flung away the sceptre, price of
my father’s murder, and this, again, has armed other
hands. l myself best know my kingdom's destiny3
no one unstained by sacred blood shall bear away there.
Dirc misfortunes my father-seul presages. Already
are sown the seeds of calamity to comc3 the plighted
pact1 is scorned. The one will not retire from the
throne he has usurped3 the other proclaims his right,
calls on the gods to witness the broken bond, and,
wandering in exile, is rousing Argos and the cities
of Greece to arms. ’Tis no light destruction that is
coming on weary Thebes3 weaponS, flames, wounds
