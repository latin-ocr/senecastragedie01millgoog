OCTAVIA ’

Nuusu

ln vain dost thou call upon thy father's ghost,
poor girl, in vain, for no aare for his child abides
amidst the shades with him who to his own son
could prefer one born of other blood, and, taking his
brother's child to wife, wed her with ‘couch incestuous
and gloomy torch. Thence sprung a train of crimes
-murders, deceits‚ the lust for empne, thirst for
illustrious blood; as viatim offered to the father’s
marriage-bed the son-in-law was slain, lest, wedded
to thee he might become too strong. Oh, monstrous
crime! To a woman was Silanus given as a boon
and with his blood defiled the ancestral gods, charged
with a crime that was not his. Then entered the
foe, ah me! into the conquered palate, by a step-
mother’s wiles made an emperor's son-in-law and
son withal‚ a youth of bent unnatural, fertile incrime,
whose passion thy cruel mother fanned, and forced
thee by sear to wed him, 'gainst thy will. Triumphant
and emboldened by such suceesS, she dared aspire to
the awful empire of the world. Who can rehearse
the various forms of crime, the wicked hopes, the
cozening wiles of her who by all crimes would mount
to empire round by round? Then holy Piety with
trembling step withdrew, and raging Fury with bale-
ful feet entered the empty palace, defiled with
Stygian toroh the holy household-gods, and in mad
rage rent nature's laws and all things sacred. The
wife for her husband mingled deadly poison, and
soon by her son's crime the same wife fell. Thou
too dost lie dead, unhappy youth, ever to be moumed
by us, but late the world's star, the prop of a noble

house, Britannicus, and now, ah me! only light ashes
