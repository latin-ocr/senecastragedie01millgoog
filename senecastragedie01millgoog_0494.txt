CHORUS

Why do you stir up dire 011110 in vain? Invineible
the shafts that Cupid bears; with his own flames
will he o'erwhelm your lires, with which he 011 hos
quenehed thuoderbolts and dragged Jove as his
captive from the sky. To the offended god1 dire
penalties shall you pay e’en with your blood. Not
· slow to wrath is the glowing boy, nor easy to be
ruled; ’twas he who bade the fieroe Achilles smite
the lyre, broke down the Greeks, broke down Atrides,
the kingdoms 01 Priam overthrow, and lamed cities
utterly destroyed; and now my mind shudders 01
the thought 01 what the uncheoked power of the ⁵
relentless god will do.

NERO

Oh, too slow 010 my soldiers’ hands, and too
patient my wrath after such sacrilege 00 this, seeing
that the blood 01 citizens has not quenched the lires
they kindled ’gainst me, and thot with the slaughter
01 her people mouming Rome reekslnot, who bore
such men as these. But she for whos'e sake the
⁸ citizens rage at me, my sister-wife whom with dis-
trustl ever look upon, shall give her life at last to
sate my grief, and quench my anger with her blood.
But now death is too light a punishment for her
deeds. Heavier doom has the people's unhallowed

¹ Cupid.
