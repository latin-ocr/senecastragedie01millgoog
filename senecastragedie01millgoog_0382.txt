PHOENISSAE

with my hands driven deep pluck out every part
where voices enter and where a narrow passage gives
access to the words of men3 then, daughter, thy

wretched father would have escaped all consciousness
of thee, who art part and parcel of my crimes.

2⁸1 My guilt sticks fast within me, threatens each
moment to break out afresh, and my ears pourt'in upon
me all that you, my eyeS, have bestowed.1 Why do
l not plunge this life, weighted with gloom‚ down to
the everlasting shades of Dis? Why here do Ι detain
my ghost? Why do l burden the earth and wander
amongst the living? What evil is lest for me? My
kingdom, parents, children, my manhood, too, and
the illustrious fame of my cunning wit-all these
have perished, all have been stripped from me by
hostile chance. Tears were still left me—of these,
too, have l robbed myself.

²41 Stand off! My soul will not listen to any prayers
and seeks some new punishment to match its crimes,
And what match can there be? Even in my infancy
Ι was doomed to death. Who ever drew lot so sad?
Ι had not yet seen the light, was still imprisoned in
the womb, and already l was held in sear. Some
there are whom straightway at birth night hath
seized upon and snatched from their first dawn; but
on me death came ere birth. Some, while still
within the mother’s womb, have suffered untimely

ἵ death; but have they sinned also? Hidden away,

confined, my very being in doubt, the god made
me guilty of a charge unspeakable. On that charge
my sire condemned me, spitted my slender ankles
on hot iron, and sent me to the deep forest as prey
