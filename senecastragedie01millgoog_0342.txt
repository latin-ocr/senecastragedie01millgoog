HERCULES OETAEUS

the blaaing pine; the flames shrunk back, the torch ¹ ¹
resisted and would not touch his limbs; but Hercules
followed up the shrinking flames, Thou wouldst
suppose that Caucasus or Pindus or Athos was
ablaze3 no sound burst forth, save that the fire
seemed groaning. Ο stubborn beart! Had huge
Typhon been lying 011 that pyre, he would have

groaned aloud, and fierce Enceladus who upon his
shoulders bore Ossa, uptorn froni earth.

¹⁷⁸⁶ But Herculea, midst roaring flames upstarting,
all charred and mangled,· gazed dauntless round and ,
cried: “Now art thou parent 1111 01 111101111; thus
’tis meet that thou shouldst stand, my mother,

beside the pyre, and thus ’tis meet that Hercules be ·

moumed.’' Midst scorching heat and threat’ning
11111111, unmoved‚ unshaken, to neither side turning
his tortured 11111111, he encourages, advises, is active
still, though all aflame. To all his ministrants stout-
ness of soul he gives3 you would dcem him all on
fire to burn. The whole crowd stands in speechless
wonder and the flames have scarce belief,l so calm
his brow, the hero so majestic. Nor does he speed
his burning; but when now he deemed that courage
enough had been shown in death, from every side he

‚ dragged the burning logs which the fire least fed Ι

upon, and into that blazing mass he strode and
sought where the flames leaped highest, all unafraid,
defiant. Awhile he feasted his eyes upon the lires
But now his heavy heard burned bright3 and even
when threat’ning fire assailed his face and the hot
tongues licked about his head, he did not close his
eyes-But what is this? Ι 111 the sad mother

¹ The people hardly believed that the 1111 was real.
