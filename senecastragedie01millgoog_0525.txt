He (lenounoea Deianira because eho has brought suffering
and destruction u n him which no foe, rnen or heaut, hae

everbeen ableto ring. He oureus his own waakneas, and γ

lamenta that he must weep and groen like a woman.
He marvelu that hie mighty frame, which ior years hau

withstood uo many monoteta, hia euoountors with which he ,

describes, con now ba so wealr and wanted. Reverting to hia

wife, he bids her to be brought to him that ho may visit
punishment upon her.

Hyllus informa his father that Deianira has died by hor l

own hand, ior grief at what ahc has unwittingly brought
upon her decr lord. It was, indeed, through Nessus’ guile
that the deed wau done.

Herculea, on hearing thia, recognizea the fullilment ol the
orac e:

“ Long since it wau revealed oi my sire
That I should die by hand ol nono that live,
But one who, dead, hed dwelt in Hadea dark.’'

He exacta an oath of obediente from Hyllus, and then bida
him take him to Mount Oeta, and there place him upon a
pyro ior turning. Hyllus reluctantly conuenta in all but tho

actual firing ol the pyre. The next request is concerning ,

Iole, that Hyllus should take her as hio wile. Thia mandato
he indignantly refuses to obey, but finally yields assent,
v And in tho end Hercules is borne away to hin burning,
while the chorus mournfnlly ohants its concluding comment:

“What comcth no man may know ;
What iu, is piteous lor ua,
’ Baua and ahamelul lor thern
And for him who enduroth this woe,
Abovc all that live hard to beur.” '
