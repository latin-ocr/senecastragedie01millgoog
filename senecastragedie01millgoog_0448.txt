OCTAVIA

oc‘ravia

Sooner shall savage scas unite with stars, water with
fire, heaven with sad Tartarus, the kindly light with
darkness, day with the dewy night, than with my
accursed husband's impious soul this soul of mine,
that ever broods upon my brother's death. And oh,
that the lord of the heaven-dwellers, who osten

ἱ shakes the lands with deadly bolt and terrifies our

souls with awful fires and portents strange, would
make ready to whelm with flames this impious prince.
We have seen a glowing radiance in the sky, a
comet1 spreading its baleful troil, where slow Bootes

¹ numb with Arctic chill, with endlesS, nightlong

wheeling, guides his wain. Lo, by the pestilential

³ breath of this destructive leadcr the very air is

tainted; the stars threaten irnheard disasters for the
nations which this godless leader rules. Not such a
pest was Typhon, whom wrathful mother Earth pro·
duced in scorn of Jove; this scourge, worse than he,
this enemy of gods and men, has driven the heavenly
ones from their shrines, and citizens from their
country, from his brother has he rest the breath of life,
and drained his mother’s blood-and he still sees the
light of day, still lives and draws his baneful breath!
O high exalted father, why vainly, why so citat
random dost thou hurl thy darts invinciblc with thine
imperial hand? ’Gainst one so criminal why is thy
right hand staycd? Would that he might pay
penalty for his crimes, this spurious² Nero, son of
Domitius, tyrant of a world he burdens with his
shameful yoke, and with foul ways pollutes the name
Augustus!

² Referring to the fact that Nero was not tha true eon and
rightiul heir oi Claudius.
