AGAMEMNON

impious deeds the Cretan judge1 with whirling urn y
condemns; all of them by my crimes shall Ι, Thyes-
tes, conquer. But by my brother shall 1 be con· 1
quered, full of my three sons butied in me; my own l
flesh have l consumed.

²⁸ Nor thu's far only has Fortune defiled the sire,²
but, daring greater 'crime than that committed, she
bade him seek his daughter's incestuous embrace.
Fearlessly and to the dregs did Ι drain her bidding,
but ’twas an impious thing 1 did. And therefore, that
a father's power might extend o'er all his children,
my daughter, forced by fate,8 bore child to me, wor-
thy to call me father. Nature has been confounded;
father with grandsire, yea, monstrous! husband with
father, grandsons with sons, have Ι confused—and
day with night.

³⁷ But at length, though late and coming after
death, the promise of dim prophecy is fulhlled to me,
worn with my woes 3 that king of kings, that leader
of leaders, Agamemnon, following whose banner a
thousand ships once covered the Trojan waters with
their sails, is now at hand—to give his throat into
his wife's power. Now, now shall this house swim
in blood other than mine34 swords, axes, spears, a Ι
king's head cleft with the axe's heavy stroke, Ι see;
now crimes are near, now treachery, slaughter, gore Ι
—feasts are being spread. The author of thy birth
has come, Aegisthus.⁵ Why dost hang thy head in
shame? Why doth thy trembling hand, doubtful of
purpose, fall? Why dost take counsel with thyself,
why tum the question o’er and o'er whether this
deed become thee? Think on thy mother; it
becomes thee well.

⁸'l'heae and the remaining lines of the paragraph are
addreased to Aegisthus, seemingly aa ii he were present.
