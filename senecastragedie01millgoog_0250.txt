Centaur, now groping for light, in his right hand
caught the poison¹ flowing from the wound, and this
he gave me, ponting it into his hoof, which with
mad hand he had chaneed to wrench away. Then
with his dying words he spoke: “By this charm
magicians have said love can be firmly fixed; so were
Thessaliam wives by the wise Myoale instructod,
whom only, midst all wonder-working croues, Luna
will forsake the stars and follow, A garment,
smeared with this very gore, shalt thou give to him,
if ever a hated mistress should usurp thy chamher,
and thy ficlde husband should give another daughter
to his high-thundering sire. This let uo light be·
hold; let darkness only, thick and hidden, cover it;
so' shall the potent blood retain its powers.” Silence
seized on his words and to his weary limbo came the
sleep of death.

⁵³⁵ Now do thou, whom loyulty makes sharer of

my secret, haste thee that the poison, upon a
glittering robe besmeared, go through his heart
and limbs and, stealing silently, enter his very

marrow.

Nunsr:

With speed will I do thy bidding, dearest child;
and do thou pray to the god² invincible, who with
tender hand doth seud unerring shafts. [Exit nonen.
