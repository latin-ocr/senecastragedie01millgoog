THYESTES

Ι do accept; the name of king set on me will Ι
wear; but unto thee shall laws and arms along with
myself be subject. '

This crown, set on thy reverend head, wear thou;
but I the destined victims to the gods will pay. [Erit.

CHORUS

Such things are past belief. Atreus, there, the
fierce and savage, reckless of soul and cruel, at
sight of his brother stood as one amared. There is
no power stronger than true love 3 angry strife 'twixt

strangers doth endure, but whom true love has bound Ι

'twill bind for ever. When wrath, by great causes

roused, has burst friendship's bonds and sounded t
alarms of war; when fleet squadrons with ringing

bridles eome3 when the brandished sword gleams

now here, now there, which the mad god, of war, ·.

thirsting for fresh-flowing blood, wields with a rain ³

of blows,-then will Love stay the steel, and lead

men, even against their will, to the clasped hands of 3

Pe{diffiditis sudden lull out of so great uproar what
god has wrought? But now throughout Mycenae

. the arms of civil strife resounded; pale mothers held

fast their sona, the wife feared for her lord full
armed, when to his hand came the reluctant sword,
foul with the rust of peace3 one strove to repair
tottering walls, one to strengthen towerS‚ crumbling
with long neglect ; another strove to‘shut gates tight
with iron bars, while on the battlements the trembling
guard kept watch 0’er the troubled night—for worse
