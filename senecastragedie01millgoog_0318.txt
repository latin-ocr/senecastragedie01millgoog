HERCULES OETAEUS

take these deadly shasts out of his reach, l pray you ;
his burning cheeks portend some violence. Where
shall an old woman hide herself? That is the smart
of madness; it alone masters Hercules. But why
should l,foolish that lani, seek flight or hiding? By
a brave hand Alcmena deserves to die; so let me
perish even impiously, before some craven decree my
death, 0r a base hand triumph over me.

1412 But see, all spent with woe, his pain holds his
worn ‘heart fast bound in slumber, and his panting
chest heaves with laboured breathing. Help him, ye
gods! If to my misery ye have denied my glorious
son, at least spare to the world, l pray, its champion.
May his smart be driven quite away, and the body of
Hercules renew its strength.

[Eater uranus]

HYLLUS

0 bitter light, 0* crime-filled day! Dead is the
Thunderer's daughter,1 his son lies dying, and l, his
grandson, still survive. By my mother’s crime is he

perishing, but she was by guile ensnared. What '

aged man, throughout his round of years, in his
whole life, will be able to recount woes so great?
Both parents has one day taken off ; to say naught
of other ills and to spare the fates‚2 Hercules, my
father, am l losing.

ALCMENA

Restrain thy words, child of illustrious sire, s
wretched Alcmena's grandson, like her in fate3 per· Ἴ

chance long slumber will o’ercome his pains. But

¹ Deianira, who has just killed herself off stage.
²i.c. not to speak too hardly of them by recounting all
their cruelty. 299
