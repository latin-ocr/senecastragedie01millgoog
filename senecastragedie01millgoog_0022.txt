⁵³ But why suddenly is the summer night 'pro-
‘ longed to winter's span? or what holds the setting
stars still in the sky? Are we delaying Phoebus? ,
[Prepariag lo go] Give back the d'ay now to the
universe. [Ghoal nuchilca]

CHORUS

Ο Fortune, who dost bestow the throne's high

boon with mocking hand, in dangerous and doubtful

J state thou settest the too exalted( Never have

sceptres obtained calm peace or certain tenure; care
on care weighs them down, and ever do fresh storms
vex their souls. Not so on Libyan quicksands does
the sea rage and roll up wave on wave; not so,
stirred from their lowest depths, surge Euxine’s
waters, hard by the icy pole, where, undipped in the
azure waveS,l Bootes follows his shining wain‚ as
does Fortune roll on the headlong· fates of kings.
To be feared they long, and to be feared they dread;
kindly night gives them no safe retreat, and sleep,
which conquers care, soothes not their breasts.

⁷⁷ What palace has not crime answering crime²
hurled headlong? What palace do impious arms not
vex? Law, shame, the sacred bonds of marriage,
all flee⁴from courtS. Hard in pursuit comes grim
Bellona of the bloody hand, and she who frets the

lie. the⁰Northern constellatione never set beneath the

ml· ie. waged by one member oi a royal house against another.
