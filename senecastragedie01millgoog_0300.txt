your Hercules should perish by such death aa this?
Oh, cruel shame to me, oh, end most foul-a woman
will be called author of Alcides' death! And for
whom¹ is Alcides dying? ΙΙ the fates unchanging
have willed that by a woman's hand Ι fall, if through
distaff so base the thread of my death has run, ah

be by woman’s hand, but of one who holds the
heavens 1f, Ο ye gods, that were too much to
ask, the Amazon, born 'neath Scythian skies, might
have o'ercome my strength. But by what woman’s

, hand is Juno's foe o'eroome? This is for thee, my

stepdame, heavier2 shame. Why callest thou this
day joyful? What monster such as this has earth
produced to sate thy wrath3? A morta] woman
has outdone thy hate. Till now thou deemdst
thyself hy Alcides alone outmatched; by two hast
thou been surpassed—of such wrath let heaven be
ashamed Ι Oh, that the Nemean lion with my blood
had sated his gaping jaws‚ or that, hedged by a
hundred snakes, Ι had fed the hydra with my gore!
Ο that Ι had been given to the Centaure aa a prey,
or that midst the shades I, bound to an everlasting
rock, in wretchedness were sitting! But now have Ι
dragged here my latest spoil4 while Death looked
on amazed3 now from infernal Styx have Ι regained

ξ hand death shunned me, that I might lack at last
¹ a glorious end. 0 beasts, Ο conquered beasts!

Neither did the three-formed dog, when he saw the

¹ sun, drag me back to Styx, nor 'neath western skies

did the Spanish rout of the wild shepherd⁵ conquer
