HERCULES OETAEUS

oak1 once gave me, and the Pamassian grot,l shaking
the shrines of Cirrha with rumbling tones, declared:
s “By the hand of one whom, conquering, thou hast
slain, Alcides, one day shalt thou lie low; this end,
when thou hast traversed seas and lands and shades,
awaits thee at the last.’' We complain no more3
such end was meet, that no living thing might
conquer Hercules. Now let me choose a death -
gloriouS, renowned, illustrium, full worthy of myself.
This day will Ι make famous. Go, cut down all the
woods, heap Oeta's grove together, that a mighty
pyre may receive Hercules, and that before he dies,
Thou, son² of Poeas, dear youth, perform this sad
office for me; set the whole sky aglow with the
flames· of Hercules.

, 14⁸⁸ And now to thee, Hyllus, I bring my latest
tttt rldlligthielplll?{libfilalffllhllltd
daughter of king Eurytus. Lead her to thy
chamber with wedding torch. Victorinus, blood-
stained,l robbed her of her fatherland and home,
and to the wretched girl gave naught except
Alcides3 and now e'en he is rest from her. Let her
find recompense for her sorrows and cherish Jove’s
grandson and the son of Hercules; to thee be born
whatever seed she has conceived by me.

[To Alcmena]

¹4⁹⁷ Do thou thyself cease thy death-wails for me,
1 pray, illustrious mother3 thy Alcides lives3 by my
heroic deeds have I made my step-dame seem but

two oracles loretold the same fate, or simply mingles the two
references by way of emphasis on the oracular utteranee

itself.
