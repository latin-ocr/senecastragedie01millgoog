PHOENISSAE

ereature's flight was traeeable in blood; or where
lno’s eliff juts out into the deep sea with tower-
ing peak, where, fleeing strange crime and yet
strange crime committing, a mother leaped into the
strait to sink both son andself.1 Oh, happy they
whose better fortune has given such kindly mothersl

²⁷ There is another place within these woods, my
own place, which calls for me ; lwould fain hasten-to
it; my steps will salter not; thither will 1 go bereit
of every guide. Why keep my own place waiting?
Death, Ο Cithaeron, give me back3 restore me that
resting-place of mine, that Ι may die in age where Ι
should have died in infancy. Claim now that penalty
of old. 0 ever bloody, savage‚ oruel, fierce, both
when thou slayest and when thou sparest, this eareass
of mine long since belonged to thee ; fulfil my father’s
behest-aye, and how my mother's too. My soul
yearns to suffer the penalty of long ago. Why,
daughter, dost hold me bound by thy baleful love?

· Why dost thou hold me? My father calls, leome,

Ι come3 at last let me go 2-Laius rages yonder,
⁸ wearing the blood-stained badge of his ravished
kingdom3 see! behold! there he assails and seeks to
tear at my sightless countenance with his threatening
hands. Daughter, dost see my father? l surely see
him. [He soliloquizesl At length spew out thy hateful
breath‚ O traitor soul, brave 'gainst but a portion of
thyself. Away with the slow delays of thy long-
due punishment ; receive death wholly. Why do
1 sluggishly drag on this lise? Now can Ι do no
crime. Ι can, wreteh that Ι am, this Ι forebode—away
from thy father, away, while still a maid. Aster my
mother Ι fear all happenings.
