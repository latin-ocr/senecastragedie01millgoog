²⁰⁰ Who now of the gods, granting he wills it s0‚ can
add aught to thy misfortunes? Now not even canst
thou add aught save this, to deem thyself worthy of
death. Thou art not worthy‚ nor has any taint of
guilt touched thy heurt. And for this all the more,
father, call thyself guiltless; for thou art guiltless‚
though even the gods willed otherwise. What is it
which has so maddened thee, which has goaded thy
grief afresh? What drives thee to the infernal
regions? What forces thee out of these? That
thou mayst avoid the light of day? Thou dost
avoid it. That thou mayst flee thy noble palace
with its high walls, and thy native land? Thy
native land, though thou still livest‚ is dead to thee.
Dost flee from thy sons and mother? From the
sight of all mensate has removed thee, and whatever
death can take away from any man, this has life taken
from thee. Wouldst avoid the tumult around a
throne? They who once in prosperity thronged
around thee, at thy command have lert thee. Whom
dost thou flee, my father?

hand? Do my ears take in sound by which 1 may
still hear the name of parent or of son? I would
indeed that 1 might destroy these paths and might
