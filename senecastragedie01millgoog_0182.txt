THYESTES

constellations3 the Ram, who, ere kindly spring has
come, gives back the sails to the warm West-wind,
headlong shall plunge into the waves o'er which he
had borne the trembling Helle3 the Bull, who
before him on bright horns bears the Hyades, shall
drag the Twins down with him and the Crab’s wide·
curving claws; Alcides' Lion, with buming hest
inflamed, once morel shall fall down from the sky;
the Virgin ² shall fall to the earth she once abandoned,
and the Scales of justice with their weights shall fall
and with them shall drag the fierce Scorpion down3
old Chiron,³ who sets the feathered shafts upon
Haemonian chord, shall lose his shafts from the
snapped bowstring3 the frigid Goat4 who brings
back sluggish winter, shall fall and break thy urn,
whoe’er th0u⁵ art3 with thee shall fall the Fish, last
of the stars of heaven, and the Wain,b which was
ne'er bathed by the sea, shall be plunged beneath
the all-engulfing waves; the slippery Serpent which,
gliding like a river, separates the Bears, shall fall,
and icy Cynosura, the Lesser Bear, together with the
Dragon vast, congealed with cold; and that slow-
moving driver of his wain, Arctophylax,⁷ no longer

¹ fixed in place, shall fall.

‘Otherwise known as the “Besa’' The constellationis
unfortunataly named here. since there was no mythological
reason why tha Wain should not bs bathed in the Ocean, as
was tha case with the Bear.

. 'Seneca badly rnixes his mytholo hare. Arctophylax,
the “bear-kaapcr,’' is appropriate on v ii the Bear is men·
tionad inhia connection3 ha should be Bootes if the com·

panion constellation is thought oi as the Wain. 6
