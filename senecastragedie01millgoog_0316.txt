HERCULES OETAEUS

I bear, defiant3 were Pindus lying on me, and
Haemus, and Athos which resists the Thracian
waves‚ and Mimas which weleomes the bolts of
Jupiter3 mother, if even this sky should fall upon ⁴
my head, and over my shoulders the fiery car of
Phoebus should go flaming, no coward cry would
subdue Alcides’ soul. Though a thousand beasts at
once should rush against me and rend me sore3
though here from the skies Stymphalus' bird,
swooping with clangour wild, and there with full
strength the threatening bull should push upon me,
and whatever huge monster has sprung from earth3
though Sinis' groves should arise this side and that,
and the rough giant shoot my limbs1 afar3 rent limb
from limb, still will l hold nly peace—no heasts, no
arms, naught that can be met and vanquished shall
extort one groan from me.

ALCMENA

Son, ’tis no woman's poison melts thy frame ; but
thy hard round of labonrs, thine unceasing toil, per-
chance has fed some deadly disease in thee.

HERCULES

Disease? Where is it? Where is it, pray? Is
there still aught of evil in the 'world with me alive?
Let'it come on; let some one reaeh hither my bow
to me—-nay, my bare hands will he enough. Let it
come on, l say. [He siuks into a deep, moon-lile
elumbem]

Alas! the too great shoek of agony hath rest e'en
his sense away. [Tenthredonis] llemovehisweapons‚
