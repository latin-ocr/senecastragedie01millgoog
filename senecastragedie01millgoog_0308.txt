HERCULES OETAEUS

flhncuths

O father, turn thou thine eyes on my calamity·
Never till now has Alcides ssed to thee for aid, not

= even when around my limbs the hydra entwined its

fertile heads. Midst the infernal pools, by the black

ἒ pall 01 night enl'olded, 1 stood with Death nor did Ι
r call upon thee. So many dreadful beasts have 1
’1 o’ercome, yea kings and tyrants3 yet have 1 ne'er ’

lifted my face unto the stars. This hand 01 1111110
has ever been surety for my prayers3 no bolts for
my sake have flashed from the sacred sky-but this
day has bidden me ask somewhat of thee. 'Tis the
first to hear ‘my prayerS, 'twssl be the last. Just one
thunderbolt l ask3 count me a giant.1 l could have
laid hands on heaven no less than they3 but while 1
thought thee my sire in very truth, l spared the

’ skies. Oh, whether thou be harsh, my sire, or

merciful, lay hands on thy son with speedy death

ἵ and claim thee this 31001101101111.2

¹³⁰⁷ Or, if thy hand shrinks reluctant from the
impious task, 'gainst me release from Aetna's mount

' the burning Titans, who in their hands may heave

Pindus up, or, Ossa, thee, and by the hurled mountain
overwhelm me quite. Let Bellona burst the bars of
Erebus and with drawn sword rush upon me; or

1 send fierce Mars3 let the dread god ’gainst me be

armed. He is my brother, true, but 01 my step-
dame horn. Thou ton, Aleides' sister, but by our
sire alone, hurl thy spear, Ο Pallas, against thy
brother hurl. And to thee, my step-dame, do 1
streteh suppliant hands; do thou at least, I pray‚ let

¹ Think 01 me osone of theold giants storming heaven, and

hurl a bolt at me.
