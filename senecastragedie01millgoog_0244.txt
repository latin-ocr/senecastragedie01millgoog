HERCULES OETAEUS

oriamur

Not fled, dear Nurse ; it still remains, believe me,
deep-seated and fixed in my heart’s core3 but out-
raged love is poignant misery. '

NURSE

By magic arts and prayers commingled do wives
0st hold fast their husbands. I have bidden the
trees grow green in the midst of winter’s frost,
and the hurtling lightning stand; l have stirred up
the deep, though the winds were still, and have
calmed the heaving sea; the parched earth has
opened with fresh fountains; rocks have found
motion; the gates have l rent asunder and the
shades of Dia, and at my prayer's demand the spirits
talk, the infernal dog is still; midnight has seen the
sun, and day, the night3 the sea, land, heaven and
Tartarus yield to my will, and naught holds to law
against my incantatione Bend him we will; my

’ charms will find the way.

What herbs does Pontus grow‚ or what does Pindus
nourish ’neath the rocks of Thessaly,1wherein Ι may
find a bane to conquer him? Though Luna should
leave the stars and come down to earth, obedient to
magic; though winter should see ripe grain ; though
the swiit bolt should stand still, arrested by thy
charm3 though times be changed, and midday burn
amid the crowding stars: ’twill not bend him.
