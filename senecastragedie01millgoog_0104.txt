So but it be by this hand of thine. I leave the
altar. lf ’tis thy pleasure in my throat to plunge t
the sword,l offer my throat to thee; or if, as men ς
smite sheep, thou wouldst cut off my neck, my bent ἱ
neck waits thy stroke. The crime is ready3 thy
right hand, smeared and rank with a husband's
slaughter, purge with this blood of mine.

Aegisthus, come. My child undutifully insults her
