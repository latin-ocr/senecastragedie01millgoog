HERCULES OETAEUS

Huncutus

Believe me, mother, through my inmost parts the
hydra is wandering and with the Lernaean onel a
thousand savage beasts What flames² as hot as
these pieree the Sicilian clouds, what Lemnian lires,
or heaven's burning tract, within whose seorohing
zone³ the sun’s path may not lie? Ο nomades
throw me into the sea itself, into the river's midst—
alas! what Hister is enough for me? Though
greater than all lande, the Ocean itself will not eool
my burning pains3 to ease my woe all water will dry

' up, all moisture fail. Why, ruler of Erebus, didst

send me back to Jove? 'Twere more seemly to have
held me fast. To thy glooms restore me, and show

’ such Hercules as this to the ghosts4 Ι conquered.

Naught will Ι take away ; why dost fear Hercules a
second time? Assail me, Death, and fear not; now
do Ι brook to die.

ALCMENA

Restrain thy tears, at least, master thy pains; even
to such woes show Hercules invincible3 put death
away3 conquer the lords of hell as is thy wont.

HERCULES

If rugged Caucasus should offer me, bound by its
chains, as a feast to greedy birds? while Scythia

, mourned around, no doleful cry would issue from my

lips3 should the wandering Symplegades erush me
'twixt both their cliffs, their returning rushes would

ite. the space between the eoliptie and the celestini
eqlladll'the oreaturea he conquered on earth are now ghosts
in the lower world.
. ⁵ He is thinking oi the sufferings oi Prometheus.
