OCTAVIA

From Naevius (265-204 uc.) we have the Clastidium,

written in celebration of the victory of Marcellus (at
Clastidium in 222 ac.) over Vidumarus, king of the
Transpadane Gauls, whom Marcellus slew aud stripped
of his armour, thus gaiuing the rare spolia opima. The
play was probably written for the especial occasion
either of the triumph of Marcellus or of the celebra-
tion of his funeral.

We have also from Naevius a play variously entitled
Lupus or Romulm or Alimoaium lierni el Mavult,
evidently oue of those dramatic reproductions oi
scenes in the life of a god, euacted as a part of the
ceremonies of his worship. This play is comparable
to dramatic representations among the Greeks 1u the '
worship of Dionysus

The Ambracia and the Salinae of Ennius (239- -169
ac.) are ordinaril classed as subulae praetextae,
although Lucian Miller classes the fragments of
the Ambracia among the Saturae of Ennius3 while
Vahlen puts the Ambracia under the heading Comoe-
diarum et ceterorum caminum reliquiae, and classifies
the fragments of the Salinae under eu incertis salur-
urum libris. The Aiubraciu is evidently called after
the city of that name in Epirus, celebrated for the
long and remarkable siege which it sustained against
the Romans under M. Fulvius Nobilior. That general
finally captured the city in 189 ne. If the piece is
to be considered as a play, it was, like the Clastidium,
written in honour of the Roman general, and acted on
the occasion either of his triumph or os his funeral.

We have sour short fragments from the Paulus of
Pacuvius (220-130 nc), written in celebration of the
exploits of L. Aemilius Paulus who conquered Persona,
king of Macedonia, in the battle of Pydna, 168 ac.
