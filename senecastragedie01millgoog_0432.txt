OCT AVIA

Britons¹ ded, erstwhile to our leaders all unknown
and unsubdued. Alas, my father, by thy wife’s plots
thou liest crushed, and thy house together with thy
ehild2 bends to a tyrant’s⁸ will. ·

[Eril 10 her chamber. Enier numu]

Nouae:

Whoso, o'erpowered by the novel splendour and
the frail blessings 01 deceitful royalty‚ stands awe-
struck and amazed, lo, 'neatb the sudden blow 01
lurking Fare, let him, behold, o’erthrown, the house

and stock 01 Claudius, but now all powerful‚ under ’

whose rule the whole world was brought, whom the
ocean, long to sway unknown, obeyed and, all un·
willingly‚ received his ships Lo, he who 1116100
the Britons set a yoke, who covered unknown iloods
with his mighty fleets, who was saie midst tribes
barbaric, midst raging 6606, by his wife’s⁴ crime is
fallen3 she soon by her son’s hand fell; and by his
poison lies 11111111011161ὓ slain. The unhappy sister,⁶
yea, the unhappy wife grieves on, nor can she hide
her bitter sufferings, forced to the angry will 01 her
cruel husband. From him ever tlre pure girl 1600116,
and her husband, though by equal hate inspired,
with incestuous passion burns. Our fond love strives
in vain 10 console her grieving beart ; ber cruel
smart o’ercomes our counsels‚ nor can the noble pas-
sion of her soul be governed, but from 1161 woes she
draws new strength. Alas! bow my fears forbode
some desperate deed, which may the gods forbid.
