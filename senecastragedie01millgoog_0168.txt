THYESTES

this spot the sons of Tantalus are wont to enter on
their reign, here to seek aid midst calamity and
doubt. Here hang their votive gists3 resounding
trumpets and broken chariotS, spoils of the Myrtoan
sea,1andwheels0’ereome by treacherous axle-trees

> hang there, and memorials of the race's every crime·;

in this place isv Pelops’ Phrygiam turban hung, here
spoil of the enemy, and the embroidered robe, token
of triumph 0'er barbaric foes,

⁶⁶⁵ A dismal spring starts forth beneath the shadow,
and sluggish in a black pool creeps along ; such are
the ugly waters of dread Styx, 011 which the gods
take oath„ 'Tis said that from this place in the dark
, night the gods of death make moan; with clanking
chains the grove resounds, and the ghosts howl
moumfully. Whatever is dreadful but to hear of,
there is seen3 throngs of the long-since dead come
forth from their' ancient tombs and walk obruad,

and creatures more monstrous than men have known “

spring from the place3 nay more, through all the
wood flames go flicken'ng, and the loity beams
glow without help of iire. Oft-times the grove
re-echoes with three-throated bayings3 ott-times
ι the house is affrighted with huge, ghostly shapeS.
Nor is terror allayed by day3 the grove is a night
unto itself, and the horror of the underworld reigns
even at midday. From this spot sure responses are
given 1ο those who seek oracles; with thundering
noise the fates are uttered from the shrine, and
the cavern roars when the god sends forth his voice.

⁶⁸² When to this place maddened Atreus came,
dragging his brother's sons, the altars were decked
