OCTAVIA

Hath thy frenzy carried thee so far in madness and
thy destiny, my son, that the wrath of a mother
murdered by thy hand gives way before such woes?
Would that, ere Ι brought thee, a tiny babe, to light,
and suckled thee, savage beasts of prey had rent
my vitals; then without crime, without sense and
innocent, thou wouldst have died-my own; close
clinging to my side, thou wouldst forever see the
quiet seats of the underworld, thy grandsires and
thy sire, heroes of glorious name, whom now shanre
and grief perpetual await because of thee, thou
monster, and of me who bore such son. But why
delay to hide my face in Tartarus, as steprlame,
mother, wife, a curse unto my own?

[The Glrorl oanirhes. Enler omnum]

ocmvm [to the Chorus]

’ Restrain your tears on this glad, festal day of
Rome, lest your great love and care for me arouse
the emperor’s sharp wrath, and Ι be cause of
suffering to you. This woundl is not the first my
ι heart has felt; far heavier have 1 bome3 but this
day shall end my cares e’cn by my death. No more
shall Ι be forced to look on m'y brutal husband’ s face,
nor to enter a slave‘s chamber which Ι hate;

· Augustus' sister shall Ι be, not wife. Only mayl

be spared dire punishments and fearful death.-

3 And canst thou, poor, scolish girl, remembering thy

cruel husband's erimeS, yet hope for this? Long
kept back for this marriage-festival, thou shalt fall

¹ te. her divorsa and disgracc.
