THYESTES ,

cuorus
Speak out and tell this evil, whate’er it is.

nussuuoun ’

When my spirit is composed, when numbing sear
lets go its hold upon my limos. Oh, but I see it
still, the picture of that ghastly deed! Bear me far
hence, wild winds, oh, thither bear me whitherl the
vanished day is borne.

CHORUS

More grievously dost thou hold our minds in
doubt. Tell thou what is this thing which makes
thee shudder, and point out the doer of it. Ι
ask not who it is, but which.2 Speak out and
quickly.

MESSENGER

On the summit of the citadel a part of Pelops’
palace faces south3 its farthest side rises to moun-
tainous height, and o'erlooks the city, having beneath
its menace the people, insolent to their kings. Here
gleams the great hall that could contain a multitude,
whose gilded architraves columns glorious with varied
hues upbear. Behind this general hall, which nations
throng, the gorgeous palace stretches out o'er many
a space; and, deep withdrawn, there lies a secret
spot containing in a deep vale an ancient grove, the

. kingdom's innermost retreat. Here no tree ever

affords cheerful shade or is pruned by any knife; but
the yew-tree and the cypress and woods of gloomy
ilex-trees wave obscure, above which, towering high,
an oak looks down and overtops the grove. From

2 ¹ ie. to the other sido of tho world.
² It must be ono of tho two brothers.
