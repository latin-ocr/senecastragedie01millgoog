THE TRAGEDIES OF SENECA

that the Romans were following the line of least
resistance, since it is always easier to imitate than
to create. Furthermore, they had as yet developed
no national pride of* literature to hold them to their
own lines of national development; they had· no
forms of their own so well established that the mere
force of literary momentum would carry them steadily
on toward a fuller development,⁴ m spite of the dis-
turbing effects of the inllux of other and bet'ter models.
They had, indeed ,developed a native Saturnian verse
which, had it been allowed a free field ,might have
reached a high pitch of literary excellence: But it
speedily gave way at the approach of the more elegant
imported forms ·

The overwhelming influence of Greek tragedy upon
Δ the Roman dramatists can be seen at a glance as we
review the dramatic product of the Roman tragediam.
We have titles and fragments of nine tragedies by
Livius Andronicus seven by Naevius, twenty-two by
Ennius thirteen by Pacuvius, forty-six by Accius, and
many fragments from each of these, unassignable to
definite playa, which indicate numerous other plays of
the same character. To these should be added addi-
tional fragments from nearly a scote more of Roman
writers during the next two hundred years after
Accius. All the above-mentioned plays arcon Greek
subjects3 and most of those whose fragments are suf-
ficiently extensive to allow us to form an opinion of
their character are either translations or close imita-
tions of the Greeks, or are so influenced by these as to
be decidedly Greek rather than Roman in character.

And what of the genuine Roman dramatic product?

drama, alone, the entire output, so far as our records
