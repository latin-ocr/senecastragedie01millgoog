’Twill easily be erushed. Let the merita of thy
sainted father¹ break thy will,² and thy wife's youth,
her saith, her chastity.

NERO

Have done at last; already too wearisome has thy
insistence grown3 permit me to do what Seneca
disapproves. Long since am l myself Poppaeas
prayers delaying‚ since in her womb she bears a
pledge and part of me. Why not appoint to· morrow
for the wedding day? [Eaeuat.

AGRIPPINA ⁹

Through the rent earth from Tartarus have l come
forth, bringing in bloody hand a Stygian torch to
these curst marriage rites With these flames let
Poppaea wed my son, which a mother’s avenging
hand and grief shall turn to grim funeral pyres.
Ever amidst the shades the memory of my impious
murder abides with me, burdening my ghost still
unavenged. The payment l received for all my
services was that death-fraught ship, and the reward
of empire, that night wherein l mourned my wreck.
My comrades' murder and my son’s heartless
crime 1 would have wept-no time was given for

¹i..e his adoptiv velat har, Claudius.
