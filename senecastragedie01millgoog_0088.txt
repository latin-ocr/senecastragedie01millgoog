Ye faithful slaveS, restrain her till she throw off
the god,1 lest in her wild frenzy she' do some harm.
But thee, O father, who the dire thunder hurlest,
and driv’st the clouds, who the stara and lands dost
rule, to whom in triumph victors bring their spoils;

and thee, sister of thino almighty iord, Argolian
Juno, gladly with votive flocks, with gifts2 from
Araby‚ and with suppliant heart will Ι adore.
