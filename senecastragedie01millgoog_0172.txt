THYESTES

within himself whom first to slay, whom next to
sacrifice by the second stroke. It matters not, but
still he hesitates‚ and gloats over the ordering of his·
savage crime.

CHORUS

ιἍιἸέοιῃ, for all that, does he first attack with the
see .

MESSENGER

The place of honour (lest you deem him lacking
in reverenoe) to his grandsire1 is allotted—Tantalus
is the first vietim.

CHORUS

With what spirit, with what oountenance bore the
lad his death?

massenum

Careless of self he stood, nor did he plead, knowing
such prayer were vain3 but in his wound the savage d
buried the sword and, deep thrusting, joined hand ἰ
with throat. The sword withdrawn‚ the corpse still
stood erect, and when it had wavered long whether
here or there to fall, it fell upon the uncle. Then
Plisthenes to the altar did that butoher drag and set
him near his brother. His head with a blow he
severed; down fell the body when the neck was
smitten‚ and the head rolled away, grieving withh
murmur inarticulate.

CHORUS

What did he then after the double murder? Did
he spare one boy, or did he heap crime on crime? ,

¹ he. the boy, Tantalus, is named after his grandfather.
This ‘⁸ plaoe of honour '’ is a ghautly jest.
