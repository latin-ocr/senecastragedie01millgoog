drinkest of Erasinus’ cool waters‚ who of Eurotas,
and who of Ismenus drinkest‚ silently flowing along

quering Phoebus, loose, and thy quiver, full of swift
arrotvS, lay down from thy shoulder and let resound‚
smit by thy flying fingers, the tuneful lyre. No
stern, high strains in lofty measures would Ι have it

modulate on lighter shell, when the learned Muse
surveys thy sports. ’Tis thy right, too, on heavier
stringo to sound such strain as thou sangest when
gods saw Titans by thunder overcome‚ even when
mountains‚ on lofty monntains set, fumished pothway

for grim monsters, when Pelion stood on Ossa set

⁹ hemath, and cloud-capped Olympus weighed on
both. ‘
