HERCULES OETAEUS

son, seizes the shadowy spirits? Does the boatman
draw away his skiff in flight? Do Thessalian
Centaurs with flying hoofs smite the affrighted
ghosts? Does the hydra in terror plunge his snaky
heads beneath the waves and do thy toils all fear
thee, Ο my son? Fooled, fooled am 1, distracted, mad!
Nor ghosts nor shadows are afraid of thee 3 the sear-
some pelt, stripped from the Argolie lion, with its
tawny mane shields thy left arm no more, and its
savage teeth hedge not thy temples3 thy quiver '
thou hast given away and now a lesser hand will
aim thy shafts. Unarmed, my son, thou, farest
through the shadeS, and with them forever shalt
thou abide. ’

nnn volet 'oa n'nncotas [from abono]

Why, since 1 hold the realms of starry heaven and
at last have attained the skies, dost by lamentation

t ' bid me taste of death? Give o’er3 for now has my

valour borne me to the stars and to the gods them-
selves.

nenena [bemihtered]

Whence, oh, whence falls that sound upon my
startled ears? Whence do the thunderous tones bid
check my weeping? Now know I that chaos has,
been o’ercome. .

¹⁹⁴⁷ From the Styx, Ο son, art come again to me?
Broken a second time is the power of grisly death?

¹ Hast escaped once more death's stronghold and the

infernal skiff's dark pools? Is Acheron’s wan stream
