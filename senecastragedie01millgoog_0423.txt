THE. TRAGEDIES OF SENECA

are too brief to afford any adequate idea of their
character or content. But in the Brutus of Accius
(b. 170. no), which centres around the expulsion
of the Tarquins and the establishment of the Re-
public, we have a larger glirnpse into the play
through two most interesting fragments consisting
of twelve iambic trimeters and ten trochaic tetra-
meterS, respectively. ln the first, King Tarquin re-
lates to his seer an ill-ominans dream which he 'bas
had3 the second is the seer’s interpretation of this
dream,¹ pointing to Tarquin’s dethronement by Brutus.
Other short fragments give glimpses of the outrage
, of Lucretia by Sextus at Collatia, and tho scene in
the forum where Brutus takes his oath of office as .
first consul. This play, unlike its predecessors, was
not written at the time of the events which it
portrays, but may still be classed with them, so far as
its object is concerned, since it is generally thought
to have been written in honour of D. Junius Brutus,
who was consul in 138 no, and with whom the poet
enjoyed an intimate friendship.

Another praetexto of Accius is preserved, the Decius,
of which eleven short fragments remain. This play
celebrates the victory of Quintus Fabius Maximus
and P. Decius Mus over the Samnites and Gauls at
Sentinum in 295 nc. The climax of the play would
be the sels—immolation of Decius after the example
of his father in the Latin war of 340 nc.

In addition to these plays of the Roman dramatists
of the Republic, we have knowledge of a few which
date from later times. There was a historical drama
entitled lter, by L. Cornelius Balbus, who dramatized
the incidents of a journey which be made to Pompey’s
camp at Dyrrachium at the opening of civil war in
49 nc. Balbus was under commission from Caesar
