THYESTES

THE GHOST OF TANTALUS

,Wuo from the accursed regions of the dead haleth

me forth, snatching at food which ever fleeth from
my ’hungry lips? What god for his undoing showeth
again to Tantalus the abodes of the living? Hath 2
something worse been found than parching thirst
midst water, worse than ever· -gaping hunger? Cometh
the slippery stone of Sisyphus to be borne upon my
shoulders? or the wheell stretching apart my limbs
in its swift round? or Tityus' pangS, wh0, stretched
in a huge cavern, with torn outvitals feeds the dusky
birds and ,by night renewing whate' er he lost by day,
lies an undiminished banquet for new monsters?
To what new suffering am I shifted ?l0 whoe' er thou
art, harsh judge of shades, who dost allot fresh pun-

* ” ishinents to the dead,)if aught can be added to my

sufferings whereat e’en the guardian of our dread
prison-house would quake, whereat sad Acheron would
be seized with dread, with fear whereof l, too, should
tremble, seek thou it out. Now from my seed a
multitude is coming up which its own race shall
out-do, which shall make me seem innocent, and
dare things yet undared. Whatever space is still,
empty in the unholy realm, Ι2 shall fill up; never,
while Pelops' house is standing, will Μίιιοε3 be at

rest.
