THYESTES §⁶sp

rrrvrrrrs [in soliloquy]
Why Ο soul, dost hesitare, or why dost eo long l,

turn o’er and o'er a plan so simple? Dost thou trust ¹ ’
to things most unsure, to a brother and to kingship? l
Dost fear hardships already mastered, already easier ξ
to bear, and dost flee from distresses well employed ?1 l>
'Tis sweet now to be wretched. Turn book, while l
still thou mayest, and save thyself. ³

TANTALUS

What cause pompels thee, father, to turn thee
back from sight of thy native land? Why from 'so
great blessings dost withhold thy bosomi² Thy
brother returns to thee with wrath given o'er, gives
thee back half the realm, unites the members of thy ·
sundered house, and to thyself restores thee.

THYESTBS

My cause of sear, which I‘myself know not, thou
demandest of me. Naught to be feared Ι see, but
still Ι fear. Fain would l go, but my limbs totter
with faltering kneeS, and other-whither than l strive
to go am I borne away in thrall. Just so a ship‚
urged on by oar and soil, the tide, resisting both oar

and sail, bears back.
renierus

O’ereome thou whate'er opposes and thwarts thy
will, and see how great rewards await thee on thy
return. Father‚ thou const be king. ’

Tflrrsrrs
Yea, since l can die.³

8Tho power to die is more prooioue than tho power oi
kings3 sinoe, therefore, ho corr dio, Thyestes has indeed regal

power.
