THYESTES

rnunsrns
1 'call on the gods who guard the innocent.

ATREUS

⁵ Why not the marriage-gods?

rnrasrns
Who punishes crime with crime?

ATREUS

1 know what thou complainst of: thou grievest· i„
that 1 have forestalled thee in the crime, and art ’
distressed, not because thou hast consumed the
ghastly feast, but because thou didst not offer it ⁴
to me. This had been thy purpose, to prepare for
thine unwitting brother a like feast, 'and with their
mother's aid to assail his sons and lay them low in
like destruction. This one thing stayed thee—thou
didst think them thine. ⁴

Tnvus'rss

Ι The gods will be present to avenge3 to them for
punishment my prayers deliver thee.

Annuus
To thy sons for punishment do Ι deliver thee.
