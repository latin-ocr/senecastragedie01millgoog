THYESTES

⁸⁷⁵ Have we of all mankind been deemed de·
serving that heaven, its poles uptom, should over· d
whelm us? In our time has the last day come?
Alas for .,us by bitter fate begotten‚ to misery
doomed, whether we haie lost the sun or banished
it! Away with lamentatione, begone‚ O fear!
Greedy indeed for life rs he who would not die

when the world is perishing ιιι his company. ξ

have Ι attained.) 'Tis well, ’tis more than well, now

ι 'tis enough even for me. But why enough? Nay,
1 will go forward‚ e'en though the father is full-fed

with his dead ειοιιε».3 That shame might not hold

me back, day has departed. On! while heaven is
tenantless. 0 that I might stay the fleeing deities,⁴
might force and draw them hither that they all
might see the avenging feast! But 'tis enough if

but the father see. Even though daylight refuse

, me aid, I’ll dispel the darkness from thee, beneath
which thy woes are lurking. Τοο long thou liest at

feast with care-free and eheerful countenance3 now
enough time has been given to tables, enough to

¹ wine; for such monstrous ills there needs Thyestes
sober. s§To the aluam] Ye menial throng, open the
‚ temple oors, let the banquet -hall be disclosed 'Tis

{⁰11³The horror of the drought of blood and wine is still to
. oow.
