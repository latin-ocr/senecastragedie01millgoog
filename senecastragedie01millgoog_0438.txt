OCTAVIA · · ·

hated‚ and set beneath my slave,1 the sweet light
brings 110 joy to me; for my heart is ever trembling,
not with the fear of death, but of crime ²—be crime
but lacking to my misfortuneS, death will be delight.
For ’tis a punishment far worse than death to look
in the tyrant's face, all swollen with rage ’gainst
wretched me, to kiss my foe, to fear his very nod,
obedience to¹ whom my smarting grief could not
endure after my brother’s death, most sinfully de-
stroyed,whose throne he usurps, and rejoices in being
the worker of a death unspeakable. How oft does
my brother’s sad shade appear before my eyes when

' rest has relaxed my body, and sleep weighed down
³ 1111111111ἶέ111111111111111111
1 purpose aims at his brother’s eyes dud face ; and 110111

in trembling fright takes refuge in my chamber3 his
enemy pursues and‚e’en while the lad clings in my

1 embrace, savagely he thrusts his sword through both

our bodies. Then trembling and mighty terror
banish my slumbers, and bring back to my wretched
beart its grief and fear. Add to all this the proud

i concubine, bedecked with our house's spoil‚ as gift

for whom the son set his own mother on the Stygian
bark3 and, when she had o'ercome dread shipwreck
and the sea, himself more pitiless than ocean’s
waveS, slew her with the sword. What hope of
safety, after crime so great, have 1 i My victorious

, foe threatens my chamber, blazes with hate of me, ·

and, as the reward of her adultery, demands of my
husband his lawful consort's head. Arise thou, my

' father, from the shades and bring help to thy¹

daughter who calls on thee3 or else, rending the
earth, lay bare the Stygiam abyss‚ that l may plunge -
thither headlong.
