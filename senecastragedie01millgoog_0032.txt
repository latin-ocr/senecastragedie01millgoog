AGAMEMNON

smitten‚ unmoved by prayer, he held as spoil the
child of Smynthean Apollo‘s aged priest,1 then as
now mad with passion for a sacred maid.² N either
Achilles, unmoved by threats could bend him, nor
he³ who alone sees‘the secrets of the universe, (for
. me and mine sure seer, for slave-girls of no weight),⁴
nor the plague-smit people, nor the blazing pyrea
Midstthe death-struggle of falling Greece, conquered,
but by no foe, he languishes, has leisure for love,
seeks new amours3 and, lest his widowed couch ever
be free from some barbaric mistress, he lusted for the
Lymesian maid‚⁵ Achilles' spoil, nor blushed to bear
her away, torn from her lord’s embrace—he, the
enemy of Paris! NoW, wounded afresh, he rages
with passion for the inspired Phrygian maid;⁶ and ¹
aster Troy's conquest, aster Ilium’s overthrow, he
comes back home, a captive’s husband and Priam's
son-in-law!
1⁹⁸ Now gird thee up, my soul; no trivial strife art
thou preparing. Crime must be forestalled.⁷ Slug-
gisb, what day dost thou await? Till Phrygian
wives shall wield our Pelops’ sceptre? Do the virgin
daughters of thy house and Orestes, image of his
father, hold thee back? Nay, ‘tis the ills that
thot threaten them that should urge thee on3 o’er
' thema stormof woeshangslowering. Why, wretched ,
woman, dost thou hesitate? For thy children a mad

step-dame is at hand. Through thine own side, if
not otherwise it can be done,let the sword be driven,
and so slay two. Mingle thy blood with his, in thy
death destroy thy husband ; death hatli no pang when
shored with whom thou wouldest.
