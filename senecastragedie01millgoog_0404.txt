4⁸⁸ Do thou put by the sword, who art the sword's
first cause. If · thou hatest peace, if ’tis thy pleasure
to rage in war, thy mother begs brief truce of thee,
that to her son returned from exile she may give a
kiss—-the first, perchance the last. While Ι beg for
peace, hearken ye, unarmed. Doth he fcar thee3
thou, him? Ifear you both, but for the sake of
both. Why dost refuse to sheathe thy drawn sword?
Be glad of any delay; ye both seek to wage a war
wherein 'twere bes't to be o’ercome. Dost thou fear
thy hostile brothcr's wiles? When one must either
cheat orbe cheated by onc’s own, do thou thyself
suffer rather than commit the crime. But do not
fear3 thy mother will shield thee from snares on
either hand. Do Ι prevail? or must Ienvyl your
father? Have Ι come to prevent crime? or to see
it done before my eyes? [ursocius yiehls to her] Hc

are laid aside.

native soil, the gods of a foreign king protect3 thee
many seas far distant, many fates ha've driven wan·
dering. Thy mother, at thy side, did not lead thee
to thy first bridal chamber, nor with her own hand
deck the festal hall, nor with sacred fillets wreathe
the glad torches. As wedding gifts no rich golden
treasure, no fields, no cities did thy father-in·law
bestow: war is thy bridal gm. Thou hast become
thine enemy's son, far from thy land, guest of an
