HERCULES OETAEUS

And with no common weapon let thy hand be armed 3
let that bolt leap from. heaven with which, had

f Alcides not sprung from thee, thou wouldst have

scorched the Hydra. Destroy meas some strange
pest, as a scourge far worse than step-dame’s wrath.
Launch such a holt as once thou didst hurl at stray-
ing Phaethon3 for l, e’en l myself, in Hercules alone
have ruined nations.

⁸⁶⁶ But why dost ask weapons of the gods? At
last spare thy father} The wife of Hercules should
be ashamed to pray for death; this hand shall grant
my prayer3 from myself let death he sought. Then

κ quickly seize the sword.-Why then the sword?

Whateuer brings to death is weapon all-sufficient—
from a sky-piercing cliff I’ll cast me down. Let this,
this crag of Oeta, which is the first to greet the new-
bom day, be chosen3 from this 'tis well to fling me.
May its broken crags rend munder, and every rock
take its share of me; may my mangled hands hang
there, and may the whole rough mountain-side run
red. One death is all too light—light? but still it
can be prolonged. Thou canst not choose, Ο soul,
on what weapon thou shalt fall. Oh, would that the
sword of Hercules were hanging in my chamber!
Upon that steel 'twere well for meto die. But is it
enough that by one right hand 1 perish? Come all
ye nations3 let the world cast rocks and huge lire-
brands on me; let no hand shrink its task; seiae
weaponS, for your avengcr have l done to death.
Now with impunity shall crucl kings wield sceptres;
yea, with impunity now fierce monsters shall be born;
again shall altars he found wont to behold victim
like to worshipper.² Α highway to crime have l

¹ ie. do not impone thy unishment on Jove.
² ic. where human aaa ' ces are offered up.
