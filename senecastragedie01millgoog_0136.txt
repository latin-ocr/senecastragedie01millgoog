THYESTES

what it is, but 'tis some mighty thing. So let it be.
Haste, thou, my soul, and do it. ’Tis a deed worthy
of Thyestes, and of Atreus worthy3 let each perform
it. The Odrysianl, house once saw a feast unspeak-
able-'tis a monstrous crime, l grant, but it has
been done before; let my smart find something
worse than this. Inspire my soul, Ο Daulian2
mother, aye and sister,⁸ too ; my case is like to yours ;
help me and urge 011 my hand. Let the father with
joyous greed rend his sons, and his own flesh devour.
'Tis well, more than enough. This way of punish-
ment is pleasing.

2⁸⁰ Meanwhile, where is he? Why does Atreus so
long live harmless? Already before mine eyes flits
the whole picture of the slaughter3 his lost children
heaped up before their father’s face-O soul, why
dost shrink back in fear and halt before the deed?
Come! thou must dare it! What is the crowning
outrage in this crime he himself shall do.

<ATTuNDANT

But with what wiles caught will he be led to set
foot within our suares? He counts us all enemies

Aratus

He could not be caught were he not bent on
catching. Even now he hopes to gain my kingdom;
in this hope he will face Jove as he brandishes his
thunder-bolt‚ in this hope will brave the whirlpool's
rage and enter the treacherous waters of the Libyan
sands3 in this hope (what he deems the greatest
curse of all), he will see his brother.
