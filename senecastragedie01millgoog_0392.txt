PHOENISSAE

my fame and praises and do some deed whereat your ,
father may rejoice that he has lived till now. You
will do it, Ι know: of such mind were you born3 no
trivial, no common crime can such high birth per-
form. Forward your arms! With torches have at
your household gods3 reap with fire the ripened
grain of your native land; confound all things, hurry
all to destruction; on all sides throw down the waHS,
raze them to the ground; bury the gods beneath
their own temples ; the defiled deities of your
hearths melt in the fire‚ and let our whole house
from its foundations fall ; let the city be oonsumed
——and be my marriage chamber the first to feel the
flames.

ANTIGONE

Give o’er this raging storm of grief ; let the
public calamities prevail with thee3 go to thy sons
as the adviser of calm peace.

ormena

Seest thou an old man given to gentle thoughts?
dost summon me as lover of calm peace to take her
part? My heart swells with rage, my smarting grief
burns measureleSS, and Ι long for some crime more
dreadful than what the easual madness of young men
attempts. Not enough for me is war that as yet is
between citizens ; let brother rush on brother. Nor
is that enough; that, as is due, a horror may be
wrought after my fashion, one that may befit my
marriage-couch, arm ye your mother. Let no one
drag me from these woods! ΙἸΙ lurk in the cliffs’
ware-worn caves or hide away in the thick under-

’ brush. Here will Ι catch at vague rumours and

hear of the dire strife of brothers as Ι may.
