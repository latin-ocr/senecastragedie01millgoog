down your arms with speed? Or shall l tell from
what father, too? Your right hands—to your mother
give thern, give while they are still filial. Ignorance

whole crime was Fortune'S, who sinned against us;

know. Itis yours to ohoose which thing you will:
if holy affection please you, grant to your mother
peace3 if crime has pleased‚ a greater is to hand-
