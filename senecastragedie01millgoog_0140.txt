THYESTES

aratus

Though noue should teach them the ways 01
treachery and crime, the throne will teach them.
Lest they become evil, fearest thou? They were
born evil. What thou callest savage, cruel, thinkest
is done ruthlessly, with no regard 101 heaveu's law,
perchance even there 1 is being done.

¹Shall thy sons know that this snare is being laid?

ATREUS

Silent discretion is not found in years 00 10-
experienced3 perchance they will disclose the plot 3
the art 01 silence is taught by life's many ills.

ATTENDANT

Even those by whom thou plannest to deceive
ι another, wilt thou deceive?

Arabus

That they themselves may be free even from
, blame 01 crime. What need to entangle my sons in
guilt? By my own 0011 101 my hatred be wrought
out-Thou doest ill, thou shrinkest back, my soul.

Let Agamemnon be the witting agent of my plan, ⁶

and Menelaus wittingly assist his father. By this deed
let their uncertain birth be put to proof ε 11 they
refuse the combat‚ 11 they will not wage the war 01
hate, 11 they plead he is their uncle, he is their sire. ’
Let them set forth-But a troubled countenance oft
discloses much 3 great plans betray their bearer even
against his will ; let them not know of how great a
matter they are the ministers. And do thou conceal
my plans .
