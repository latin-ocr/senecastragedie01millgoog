THYESTES N

Thyestes, this o'nly good remains, that thou knowest
not thy woes. But even this will perish. Though
Titan himself should turn his chariot back, taking
the opposite course3 though heavy night, rising at
dawn and at another's1 time, with strange shadows

should bury this ghastly deed, still it must out. t

There is no sin but it shall be revealed.
[Unnalaral darkness has settled over rte world]

Whither, 0 father of the lands and skies, before

y
l

whose rising thick night with all her glories fleca, ἶ
whither dost turn thy course and why dost blot out ξ

the day in mid-Olympus?² Why, Ο Phoebus, dost

snatch away thy face? Not yet does Vesper, ᾖ

twilight's messenger, summan the lires of night: not
yet does thy wheel, turning its western goal, bid free
thy steeds from their completed task; not yet as day
fades into night has the third trump sounded ;8 the

ploughman with oxen yet unwearied stands amared at ¹
his supper-hour’s quick coming. What has driven ς’

thee from thy heavenly course? What cause from '

their fixed traek has turned aside thy horses? Is
the prison-house of Dis thrown wide and are the
conquered Giants again essaying war? Doth sore-
wounded Tityos repew in his weary breast his ancient
wrath? Has Typhoeus thrown off the mountainous
mass and set his body free? Is a highway being built
by the Phlegraean⁴ foe, and does Thessalian Pelion
press on Thracian Ossa?

³The Greek day was divided into three parts of four
houre each. The third trump sounding would indicate the
beginning oi day’s last third.

ie. the Giants, so called from Phlegra, a valleyin Thrace,
where started their battle against the goda.
