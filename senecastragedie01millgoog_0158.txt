THYESTES

beart share a brother’s kingdom. Mine is the greater
glory, to restore to a brother all unharmed ancestral
dignity3 wielding of power is the work of chance, ·
bestowing of it, virtue's.

THvEsTEs

May the gods, my brother, fitly repay thee for so
great deserte. The kingly crown my wretched state
refuses, and the sceptre my ill-omened hand rejects
Let it be mine to hide amidst the throng.

Arnnos
Our throne has room for two.

rurcsrss
Ι count, my brother, all of thine as mine.1

brunus
Who puts aside inflowing fortune's gifts?

rnrnsrcs
Whoso has found how easily they ebb.

Arabus

Dost forbid thy brother to gain great glory?

TflYssTns

Thy glory is won already; mine is still toiwin: to
refuse the throne is my fixed intent.

Arabus

Α My glory must Ι abandon, unless thou accept thy

share. ¹But1wnrn0ttak0p0neo10n0ro. ¹37
