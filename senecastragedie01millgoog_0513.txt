THE TRAGEDIES OF SENECA

Second choral interludo—The chorus sings ol Helen es
the benc of the Trojens:

⁴‘ Dirc cause oi striie with bloodshed in her trcin.'’

And now

“The penalty oi foul dishonour done
To friendship's boerd end Zeus ''

hes been peid hp Troy, which is lilrencd ιο e men who
, which is hermless while still young, but

fosters e lion’s cu
when full grown “it shows the nature oi its sires,’ and
brings destruction to the house that shcltered it.

Third ephon-Agamemnon is, seen eppronrhing in his
cheriot, followed by his trein ol soldiers end captives. The
chorus welcomes him, but with e veiled hint thet nll is not
well in Ar os. Agamemnon fittin ly theuks the ods ior his
success end lor his seio return, and promises in ue time ιο
investigate affairs nt home.

clytemnestra, now entering, in ο long speech oi fulsome
welcome, describes the grief which she has endurcd lor her
lord’s long absence in the midst oi perils, end protests her
own absolute faithfulness to him. She ex leins the absence
oi Orestes by saying thet she hes entrusted him to Strophius,
king of Phocis, to be enred for in the midst oi the troublous

times. She concludes with the ambiguous prayer:

“Ah, Zeus, work out ior me
All thet Ι prny for3 let it be thy cere
To look to thet thou purposest to work.”

Agamemnon, aiter bricfly referring to Cassandro und
bespeaking kindl treatment for her, goes into the prisce,
accompenied by ytemnestra.

Third chorcl iruerlude. -The chorus, though it sees with
its own eyes that cll is well with Agamemnon, that he is
returned in selety to his own home, is filled with sud
forebodings of some bovering evil which it cannot dispel

Exodo—Clytemestra returns end bids Cassandra, who
still remeius standing in her chariot, to join the other slaves
in ministering et the alter. But Cassandro stands motionless‚
peying no hecd ιο the words oi the queen, who leaves the
scene snying:

“I will not beer the shcme oi uttering more.”
