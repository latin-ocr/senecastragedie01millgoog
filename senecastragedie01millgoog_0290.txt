HERCULES OETAEUS

flvttus

Ah me! in frenzy has she fled. Already 1100 my ·

mother played her pert—she 1100 resolved on death 3
now does my part remain, to thwart her deadly
purpose. Ο wretched plight 01 10101 ·if thou
forbidst thy mother's death, thou wrongst thy father;
11 thou sufferest her 10 die, still ’gainst thy mother
dost thou sin. Crime drives from either hand; still

must Ι check her, thet from true1 crime she may be
saved. [Exit 0 fler 1111 mother]
