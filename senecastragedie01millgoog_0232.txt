HERCULES OETAEUS

fear; for there the unclel of thine Alcides reigns
Turn where thou wilt, poor woman, there wilt thou

see his kindred gods.
nanuum

That Ι am doing a fearful crime, e’en lmyself con-
fess; but passion bids me do it.

Nunsu

Thou’lt die.
murnum

Yea, truly, will Ι die, but the wife of glorious
Hercules; neither shall any dawn, banishing night, ·
brand me as widow ; nor shall captive creature make
capture of my bed. Sooner shall day be bomin the
western sky, sooner shall lndians grow pale ’neath

the icy pole, or Scythians tan ’neath Phoebus’ ’

buming ear, than shall the dames of Thessaly see me
abandoned With my own blood will Ι quench her²
marriage torches Either let him die or do me to
death. To slaughtered beasts let him add wife as
well, and let him count me, too, 'mongst the toils of

⁸ Hercules; to Alcides’ couch, aye with my dying body,

will l cling. Ah, sweet, 'tis sweet to go to the
shades as bride of Hercules-but not without my
vengeance. lf lole from my Hercules basconceived
a child, with mine own hands will Ι tear it forth
untimely, and by her very wedding torches' glare
will Ι face the harlot. Let him in wrath slay me
as victim on his nuptial day, so Ι but fall on the
corpse of lole. Happy he lies who erushes those he

hates
uorsa

’ Why dost thyself seed thy flames and wautonly
foster an unmeasured grief? Poor soul, why dost
thou cherish a needless fear? He did love lole;
