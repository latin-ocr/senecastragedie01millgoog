uersum

³1⁰ This age as well has seen a son’s dire crime,
when in a deadly bark the prineel sent his mother
out on the Tyrrhene sea, by a triok ensnared. At his
bidding the sailors make haste to leave the peaeeful
port and, smit by the oars, the sea resounds. The
vessel is borne far out upon the deep3 and there,
with loosened timbers, sinking, overwhelmed, it yawns

Ι wide and drinks in the sea. A mighty ontery rises

to the stars, mingled with shm'eks of women. Death
stalks dire before the eyes of all; euch for himself
seeks refuge from destruction ; some eling naked to
planks of the broken ship and face the floods, while
others, swimming, seek to gain the shore ; fate

plunges many into the depths below. Augustu²
rends vher garments and tears her hair and waters

her cheeks with grieving tears.

333 At last, with hope of safety gone, blazing with
anger and now o’ereome with woe, she eries3 “Such
reward as this [or my great boon, 0 son, dost thou
return me? Worthy am Ι of this ship, 1 do confess,
who brought thee forth, who gave thee light and
empire and the name of Caesar, fool that 1 was.
Thrust forth thy face from Acheron, and glut thee
with my punishment, 0 husband3 Ι caused thy
death, poor soul, was the author of thy son’s de-
struction, and lo, as 1 have merited, to thy ghost
am Ι now borne unburied, whelmed in the oruel ,
waters of the sea.”
